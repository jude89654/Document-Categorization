UR BAD

June 15, 2008

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing today to complain of the poor service I received from your

company on June 12, 2008. I was visited by a representative of That Awful

Company, Mr. Madman, at my home on that day.

Mr. Madman was one hour late for his appointment and offered nothing by

way of apology when he arrived at noon. Your representative did not remove

his muddy shoes upon entering my house, and consequently left a trail of dirt

in the hallway. Mr. Madman then proceeded to present a range of products to

me that I had speciﬁcally told his assistant by telephone I was not interested

in. I repeatedly tried to ask your representative about the products that were

of interest to me, but he refused to deal with my questions. We ended our

meeting after 25 minutes without either of us having accomplished anything.

I am most annoyed that I wasted a morning (and half a day's vacation) waiting

for Mr. Madman to show up. My impression of That Awful Company has been

tarnished, and I am now concerned about how my existing business is being

managed by your ﬁrm. Furthermore, Mr. Madman's inability to remove his

muddy shoes has meant that I have had to engage the services, and incur the

expense, of a professional carpet cleaner.

I trust this is not the way That Awful Company wishes to conduct business

with valued customers—I have been with you since the company was founded

and have never encountered such treatment before. I would welcome the

opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn of how you propose to

prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,

V-Angn'
