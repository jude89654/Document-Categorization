Dear Mr.Cabana,

This is to bring to your attention the behavior of Mr. Plank Charles because of his bullying to his co-workers.
There are a lot of complains about him, but on behalf of them here I am writing you this letter to inform you and
to help us in solving this problem. His behavior is unacceptable and very rude. This decreased our motivation in
working because of the things he is saying to us. I hope for your quick response, thank you and have a blessed
day!

Sincerely,

Hannah Mere
