Narrative Report

I’ve taken my OJT (On-The-Job Training) this academic year 2013 at Philippine Long Distance Tele-
phone Company (Bauan Branch). It lasted for 62 working days and includes the following activities:

I’ve been working in the MDF department, I have learned many things about PLDT, how it’s operates
and why this company is still one of the biggest telecommunication company not only in Batangas but in
the Philippines.

For my staying at PLDT I learned to be patience, discipline, and communicate to others and to be cour-
age to accomplish this tasks (OJT), newly people I have met, new location and I am not familiar, I have
no idea for this kind of work and how I accommodate to other workers ,to handle troubles and problem
that I encounter not only in the ﬁeld telecommunication but also physically and mentally problem.

As Information technology student I practiced to be organized, handling my time, broadening my skills
not only in terms of Computer, but also in the ﬁeld of works. On the Job Training is the best way to adapt
person in a new environment to be train and prepared in a real worksite.

As a former trainee (OJ T) of PLDT, I can merely say that I’ve experience how my ﬁeld of work ﬂows,
basic ofﬁce works, to be productive, developed more skill how to be conﬁdent and self-esteemed.
