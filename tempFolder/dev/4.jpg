Subject: Application for Master’s Degree in Environmental Management

Dear Professor Koh,

I am writing this letter so as to seek admission for the Master Degree Programme in Environmental
Management, which is hosted by School of Design and Environment at the National University of
Singapore. I am currently pursuing a degree at the Faculty of Science (Life Sciences), with the option
of specialising in Environmental Biology. My passion and dedication in matters related to the
environment have strongly inﬂuenced my decision to gain admission to this graduate programme.
My main goal is to improve the condition of our environment without compromising the quality of
living. I feel that this graduate programme at the National University of Singapore is the most
suitable institution for me to achieve this goal. Although I am currently lacking in relevant skills and
working experience in the ﬁeld of Environmental Management, my degree in Life Sciences with a
Specialisation in Environmental Biology provides me with the groundwork and knowledge needed for
the Masters Programme. In addition, as a Student Councilor at Meridian Junior College has honed my
leadership and team management skills. This will enable me to spearhead any future research related
to the environmental ﬁeld during my course of study.

Despite my inexperience in the ﬁeld of Environmental Management, I hope that my background in
Environmental Biology, coupled with my passion in the environment, will make me a suitable
candidate for this graduate pro gramme. For your reference, I have also attached my resume. Do
contact me if you require any additional information. I hope to hear from you soon regarding my
application.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

SIGNATURE
