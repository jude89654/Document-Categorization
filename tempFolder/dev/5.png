Dear Ms, Jobhunt:
I am writing to express my interest in the Retail Management Trainee position you listed
recently on the MOC Job Network. I have reviewed Enterprise Rent-a-Car’s web page
and am very impressed with your company’s commitment to excellent customer service
and your employee development training program I will be graduating from Mount
Olive College in August and am actively seeking a retail management position.
As you will note in the enclosed resume, I have had meaningful practical experience in
both retail sales and customer service, My positions at The Gap and Belk’s have given
me the ability to work with a wide variety of clientele. In addition, I have completed
several courses in management while pursing my baccalaureate degree in business
administration. My experiences as Secretary of the Mount Olive College Phi Beta
Lambda (national business organization) and as a member of the MOC softball team have
also helped my leadership and organizational skills,
I would like to explore the Retail Management Trainee position with you further, I will
be in Wilmington the week of February 4‘h and would love to have the opportunity to
speak with you at that time, I will call next week to see if we might identify a mutually
