Dear Mrs Jenkins

It is with regret that I find myself writing to inform you that I wish to resign from my position as
Staff Nurse on your ward, effective from the date above.

As we discussed Last week, I have been offered a position working at South Somewhere Hospital on
the neurology ward, with the prospect to train as a surgical assistant - a role I have been
interested in for some time now.

The terms of my contract required I give you six weeks’ notice of my intentions; therefore the
date on which I depart will be (insert date). If I have oustanding accumulated annual leave,
please advise me how mod: I have and when I should take it, or if it will be paid to me.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for the help, support, and opportunities I have had in
the fantastic years I have been working alongside you on this ward. It will be a shame to leave
behind such a fabulous team, but I do hope we will have the dance to work together again
someday.

Should you require any additional information from me, do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

Joe Bloggs
