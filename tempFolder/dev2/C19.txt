Good day G.U.L.P,

This is to inform you that we found something weird in the drinks i bought in your store 2 weeks ago, August 2,
2016. There are black spots ﬂoating and it smells really bad! I really don't know what that is but it is really dis-
gusting. I am pretty much disappointed with what just happened.

I am your customer for about 3 years and it's my ﬁrst time to experience this with you. I hope that this complain
will be addressed as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding and I hope you will be able to check what is
in that drink.

Sincerely,

Prince Drump
