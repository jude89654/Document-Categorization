CEO

ABC Company

15 Main St.

Sometown, MA 55555

Dear Joyce,

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as staff accountant. My last day of
employment will be June 22, 2015.

I received an offer to serve as senior accountant of a Fortune 500 company, and after careful considera-
tion, I realize that this opportunity is too exciting for me to decline.

It has been a pleasure working with you and your team over the last three years. One of the highlights of
my career was collaborating with you to automate ABC Company’s accounting, ﬁnancial and balance
systems and setting up your accounting infrastructure. Your company is poised for continued growth and
I wish you much success with your upcoming acquisition of XYZ Company.

I would like to help with the transition of my accounting duties so that systems continue to function
smoothly after my departure. I am available to help recruit and train my replacement, and I will make cer-
tain that all reporting and records are updated before my last day of work.

Joyce, thank you again for the opportunity to work for ABC Company. I wish you and your staff all the
best and I look forward to staying in touch with you. You can email me anytime at jones@somedo-
main.com or call me at 555-555-5555.

Sincerely,

Roberta Jones
