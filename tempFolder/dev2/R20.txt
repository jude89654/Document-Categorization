Dear Mr Jones

It is with regret that I tender my resignation as Ofﬁce Junior with SMUC Ltd. This follows my appoint-
ment as Ofﬁce Manager with Harrows Supplies Ltd. As I am required under my contract to give you one
month’s notice, I understand that my last day of employment will be on the 22 October 2010.

May I take this opportunity to thank you for all of the invaluable help, advice and encouragement that you
have given me during my one year with SMUC Ltd. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here but I feel the
moment is now right for me to take up new responsibilities and challenges.

Yours sincerely

Richard Brookes
