Subject: Complaint regarding service.

Dear Mr. Aid,

1 am writing this complaint because it has been two weeks since we called your company and we payed the said
fees for the shipping. Before buying out the product you had agreed to deliver it on the said date and you also said
that you are one of the fastest service in Asia. As per the agreement the item we are paying includes the warranty
for the defects and repairs.

I have already informed you about this and now I request you to follow up my product. I am hoping for you re-
sponse and I hope that this would be the last time that I would write this kind of letter to you.

Thank You,

Sincerely,

Julian Bieber
