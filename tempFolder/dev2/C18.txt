Dear Benedict Go,

With due respect I would like to inform you about the glasses you delivered us. 30% of it is broken and they are
not placed properly in their boxes. This is not what I expected, that is a lot of glasses and it was so disappointing.
Can you please replace it with a new set? And now make sure that is properly placed in your delivery truck.
Thank you for you time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Glass Resto
