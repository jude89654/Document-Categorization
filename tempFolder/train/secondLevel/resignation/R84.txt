Chairman Gino Sund

Altadena Town Council

730E. Altadena Dr,

Altadena, CA 91001

Dear Chairman Sund,

As I was campaigning throughout the community earlier this year, I met a lady who was somewhat nude to
me when I knocked on her door. She said, "The Altadena Town Council has no real power, and she then
asked me a few questions that at the time I could not answer but left a question marking my mind. It has
taken me six months to truly understand her charging statement. The Altadena Town Council has no real
power and operates as nothing more than a well-organized social club.

I will no longer be apart of an organization that does not operate as legitimate government and that is not
open, transparent and accountable to the community. Eﬁective December 15, 2009, at 12:00 noon, I resign
my position as Council Member of Census Tract 4602. Rest assured that I will remain more active than ever
in keeping our Altadena community informed, and I will continue full throttle in encouraging and spotlight-
ing the wonderﬁll progress being made in our local public schools.

I pray that the Altadena Town Council learns from this experience, and in turn legitimizes itself and becomes
truly representative govemment for the community.

Hoping for brighter days for Altadena, I remain,

Sincerely,

Herbert Simmons
