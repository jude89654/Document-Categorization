Dear

I am with great pride and honor to be part of this respected institution. Since 2012 when I joined this family,
I have always enjoyed my work. Teaching my students and also learning with them in a good environment
brought out the best in me.

It's with great sadness to tender my resignation as an Elementary teacher of this school due to my health con-
ditions. For the past months, I am not in the best of health to perform fully the responsibilities required of my
job. My family, as well as my doctor, advised me to take a Ô¨ÅJll-time rest. This would be the best option since
the situations are getting unhealthy for me.

I take this as an opportunity to thank you and my colleagues for all the support and friendship you've ren-
dered me throughout my stay. This is not very easy for me but I am proud and grateful to be given such kind
of experience.

I am looking forward for your positive response regarding this matter.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Your name
