Dear Ann,

WAITRESS RESIGNATION LETTER

I am writing this formal resignation letter to inform you that have decided to resign from my job at this
restaurant and I am giving you 2 week notice period.

When you hired me 6 months ago at ﬂiis j ob, told you that this will be a temporary work arrangement and as
soon complete my studies in the local college and ﬁnd a better job in the accounting career that prefer, will
leave this job. Now that have completed my education, it's time for me to quit this job

and concentrate on the job hunt.

really appreciate everything that you have done for me in last 6 months and I am really thankful for giving
me the opportunity to work with you. I hope you will accept my resignation and will arrange for

my last paycheck before leave.

Yours sincerely,

Ann Collins
