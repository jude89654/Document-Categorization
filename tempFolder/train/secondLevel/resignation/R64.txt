Pat Callahan New Covenant Community Church 1744 E. Nees Ave. Fresno, CA 93720

Dear Pat:

This is my formal notiÔ¨Åcation that I am resigning from New Covenant Church as a Production Intern.
Sunday, May 23rd will be my last day of employment.

I countita privilege to have had this opportunity to work at New Covenant I have learned much from you
and from those who have taken me underneath their wings during my time here. Although this was a job, for
me it was more of a ministry and an opportunity to serve Jesus, and I will be ever grateful for my time at
New Covenant.

The Lord has opened up an opportunity to go to Ellerslie discipleship school in Windsor, Colorado. I don't
know what the future may hold, but I know who holds the future.

If I can be of assistance in the future, please feel free to call on me.

In Christ's service,

Josh Kinabrew
