Subject Resignation Letter Two Week Notice Dear Mr. Flank

I am submitting my resignation from the post of Senior Tech Support engineer from your esteemed organiza-
tion, I am giving a two week's notice prior to the resignation. I apologize for this short notice period but I
have to travel to Europe to join for my new assignment. It was very difﬁcult for me to take the decision of
leaving this organization. But I believe that it will help me to achieve my future goals.

I really enjoyed working with Northampton software Ltd and this organization has deeply sharpened my
skills and expertise. I am thankful to my seniors and colleagues for all their support and guidance.

1 look for a long term relationship with the company.

Thanking you Lewis Joseph Senior Tech Support Engineer
