Dear Mr. Snodgrass

I am writing this letter because I am afraid that must resign from the current freelance writing

Work i am doing for your company. Due to the fact that have already provided the two rewrites initially
agreed to in our contract for a predetermined price and that you are unable to increase your budget on this
project must remove myself from further work on it at this time. My resignation is ofÔ¨Åcial immediately
Friday September 2014 as have already completed the Work loid out in our contract.

Please understand have enjoyed working with you but I am simply unable to put forth any further time and
talent without additional compensation. It is unfortunate that we have reached such an impossetco however
believe it is in my best interest to resign from your service.

hope you will be able to find on alternate freelance writer or in-house employee who con complete the pro-
ject to your Satisfaction, wish you well in future endeavours.

Sincerely Tracy E. Jenkins

Freelance Writer
