Dear Mr Adams

Please accept this letter as formal notice that I wish to resign from my position as Telephone Support Adviser
within ABC Solutions, with effect from the end of the day.

It is my understanding that I am not required by my contract to give notice of my intentions, although I
intend to leave at the end of my shift today. If possible, could you please arrange for my final pay to be paid
to me within Ô¨Åve working days, along with any undertaken leave entitlement, as per our agreement?

In the several years I have worked with you. I have enjoyed my employment, and feel I have learned a lot
that I can take with me. Many thanks for all of this, 2nd I in turn wish you every success in the future.

At the end of the day, I will surrender my keys and ensure they are entrusted to someone else as per company
policy. Should you require any additional information from me, do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

Jane Brown
