To whom it may concern,

In my fourteen years of service to the Newtown community have been awarded the opportunity to perform
many diverse and rewarding roles such as Youth Ofﬁcer, DARE instructor, child abuse investigator, high
school resource ofﬁcer, and patrol officer. After 34 years as police ofﬁcer however, it has come time to re-
spectﬁally submit my resignation and retire from law enforcement.

I will forever be grateful to all of the citizens who have been so supportive, encouraging, and generous in
their kind thanks to me when I have had the opportunity to serve them or their family members I hope my ef-
forts have helped to make Newtown a better community for all to live in.

Respectfully,

Officer Dana C. Schubert
