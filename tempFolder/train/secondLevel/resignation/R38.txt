Dear Mr. Majhi,

I would like to officially tender my resignation as a school nurse to take effect thirty days after receiving this
letter. I have been given an opportunity to enrich my knowledge and skills as a nurse that I could not let past.
I recently received a letter informing me that I have been chosen as one of the scholars for a training Course
on advances in the ﬁeld of nursing.

As much as I love my job as a school nurse, I feel that it is time to give attention to increasing my competen-
cy in the ﬁeld. Before I leave, I would like to thank the school and all the employees for making my stay in
the school a fruitful and happy one. Aside from being a wonderful learning experience, working in the
school has also taught me important lessons about life and have enhanced my interpersonal skills.
Thankyou.

Sincerely,

Ms. Pranati Kadak
