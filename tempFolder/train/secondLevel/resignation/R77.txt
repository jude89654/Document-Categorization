letter of resignation

August 11th

M. Paul Arcand,

During the several years I work for Informatique Rambit I have been able to learn and develop several skills
which helped improving my capabilities.

I greatly appreciated these years during which I had the opportunity to work with extraordinary people and
several became good friends. Other projects will challenge me and allow me to acquire new skills. It is with
regret that I give you my resignation as an adviser at Informatique Rambit. For this purpose, I inform you
that I would complete my work with Informatique Rambit Tuesday January 24, 2006. I thank Informatique
Rambit for the conÔ¨Ådence it always had.

Sincerely,

Marie-Chantal Toupin
