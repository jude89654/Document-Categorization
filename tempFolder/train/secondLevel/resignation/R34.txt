Honorable Steven V. Stenger 41 S. Central Avenue St, Louis, Missouri 63.105

Dear Steve:

It has been an honor to serve as a member of your administration; however, I do not want my continued
presence to distract from the important work you are doing for the citizens of St. Louis County. Therefore, I
have decided to resign

my position effective immediately

Sincerely.
