Dear Sir,

Re: Resignation from Washington Academy

I write to inform you of my decision to resign from Washington Academy as a Secondary School Teacher
with effect from 23th September, 2001. Although I have enjoyed working at WA, 1 cannot continue working
because of my other educational commitments.

I have been offered a place at Oxford University to pursue postgraduate studies for a Master's Degree
(MPhill) with possible extension for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree. The programme begins on 1st
October, 2001, but I have decided to stop work early so that I can make all the necessary arrangements and
have enough time to travel to England and arrive in good time

I will greatly treasure the experiences I have had at Washington Academy and I look forward to further asso-
ciation with the Academy during and after my studies. I would like to thank you for giving me the opportuni-
ty to be part of the staff and I wish the Management and Staff of Washington Academy every success in the
future management of the school.

Yours sincerely,

/ fall,

Lee Calton
