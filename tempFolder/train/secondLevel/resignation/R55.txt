Dear Mr. Smith.

Please accept this letter as my formal notiﬁcation of resignation from Smith & Sons. I understand that two
weeks notice is the typical standard, but fatal] possible, I would appreciate being released from my position
as soon as possible

Should assistance be required in ﬁnding a replacement, I will be more than willing to help.

I have enjoyed my time working for Smith & Sons and appreciate the support the company has shown me
during my time here.

I‘m looking forward to hearing from you regarding an end date to my employment

Sincerely,

Alex Rudloﬂ
