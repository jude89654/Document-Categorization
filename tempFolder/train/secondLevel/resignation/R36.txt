Letter from Steve Jobs

To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:

I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Ap-
ple's CEO, I would be the ﬁrst to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.

Thereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees ﬁt, as Chairman of the Board, direc-
tor and Apple employee.

As far as my successor goes, strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook
as CEO of Apple,

I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and con-
tributing to its success in a new role.

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and thank you all for the many years of being able
to work alongside yoru.

Steve
