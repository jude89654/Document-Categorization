(Date) Dear Mrs Jenkins

It is with regret that I ﬁnd myself writing to inform you that wish to resign from my position as Staff Nurse
on your ward, effective from the date above.

As we discussed last week, have been offered a position working at South Somewhere Hospital on

the neurology ward, with the prospect to train as a surgical assistant - a role have been interested in for Some
time now.

The terms of my contract required give you six weeks‘ notice of my intentions; therefore the date on which
depart will be (insert date). If I have outstanding accumulated annual leave,

please advise mehow much I have and when should take it, or if it will be paid to me.

I‘d like to take this opportunity to thank you for the help, support, and opportunities have had in the fantastic
years have been working alongside you on this ward. It will be a shame to leave

behind such a fabulous team, but I do hope we will have the chance to work together again someday.
Should you require any additional information from me, do nothesitate to contact me. Yours sincerely

Joe Bloggs
