Dr. Jill Fenimore Director of Pharmaceutical Sales Merck & Company, Inc. 1 Merck Drive Whitehouse Sta-
tion, NJ 08889

Dear Jill,

I am Writing to you today to ofÔ¨Åcially tender my resignation from Merck effective Friday, November 16.

I never thought I would ever leave such a great company as Merck, but when the opportunity arose to own
and operate my own vineyard in Napa, which as you know has always been a lifelong dream for me, I
simply had to take advantage of it.

I cannot say enough Wonderful things about Merck, about all the people I've encountered in my years of ser-
vice with the company, and especially about you and all the others on the sales team. Your leadership has
taken us all to new levels, and I have appreciated all your personal and professional advice over the years. It's
my hope that we will stay in touch as begin this new chapter in my life.

If you have any questions, please ask. Thanks again for everything.

Sincerely,

Scott Hent
