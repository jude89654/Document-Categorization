Janet Prainito, City Clerk City of Boynton Beach, FL

Dear J anet,

The purpose of this letter is to inform you that effective immediately I am resigning from my position as a
commissioner for the City of Boynton Beach. The time has come for me to move on. My new opportunities
and my mother's medical needs are my priorities. Now that my beau and are expecting a blessing in the new
year this leaves me without enough time for anything else. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as a
commissioner for 5 years. Thank you.

Sincerely,

â€”7/
