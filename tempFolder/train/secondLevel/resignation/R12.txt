It is with a bittersweet heart that must write this letter of resignation as pastor of Agape Ministries. As you
know there have been some personal and family matters that have been weighing on me as of late. After
praying and contemplating on the issues have decided to move to Colorado to be near my mother who is cur-
rently quite ill. Please consider this to be my official two weeks notice of resignation and know that my last
day as pastor will be Friday October 3, 2014.

It has been a true blessing to serve such an amazing congregation over the post four years. Will treasure each
memory and pray for the health and wellbeing of each ministry member. Please know I willco all that is in
my power to assist in the smooth transition from my departure to finding a replacement to lead the church.
Should you need to speak with me on any matter do not hesitate to call (555,555-5555 or email me atrobertaâ€”

Thank you so much for your attention in this matter. I pray that can be of strength to the congregation in my
remaining time here.

Sincerely Robert Cavanaugh
