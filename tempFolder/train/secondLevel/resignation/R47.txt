Dear Mr. Solomon:

Thank you for giving me the amazing opportunity to work at AlphaTech for the past three years. I have
learned a great deal during my employment here, and will not soon forget it. I am truly grateful for your
guidance and leadership, So it is with a heavy heart that I must announce my resignation.

The time has come for me to move on. This letter is to officially give my two weeks notice to AlphaTech.
My last day will be on April 3rd, 2014. On my part, this was not an easy choice to make. The past three years
in this organization have been highly worthwhile. I've enjoyed working for you and managing Such a mag-
niﬁcent team of engineers.

Please let me know what I can do to facilitate ﬁnding or training my replacement before I leave.

Best regards,

Brian O'Grady
