Mr. Jack Wilkins Head of Inventory Control Widgets Unlimited, Inc. 16 Ferris Blvd. Clinton, Q 4763

Dear Mr, Jenkins:

1 am formally notifying you that I'll be tendering my resignation from Widgets Unlimited, Inc. My last day
will be on November 12, 2006.

I never imagined that I would have to leave Widgets Unlimited, but due to the relocation of my wife's work
to Brisbane, I have made the decision with my wife to move up to Brisbane as a family.

If there is anything that I can do to make this transition easier for die company, let me know and I'd be more
than willing to help out.

I have truly enjoyed my work here and I would like to thank you for the opportunity that you have given me
to work here at Widgets Unlimited.

Sincerely, Signature

Scott Nelson Inventory Specialist
