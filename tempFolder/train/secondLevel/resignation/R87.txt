The Honorable Linda Lingle

Governor of Hawaii

Hawaii State Capitol

Dear Governor Lingle:

Over the past three years, it has been a pleasure to serve our community as one of the members of the Uni-
versity of Hawai'i Board of Regents. However, given the recent decision by the Hawai'i Supreme Court, I
ﬁnd it in the best interest of the institution to resign from my seat as the Student Regent, effective immediate-
1y.

I have sincerely enjoyed the opportunity to serve our University and our State in this capacity, and will
always cherish the relationships I have fostered as a result of my work. It is my hope that my service on the
Board helped to make a positive

impact,

Thank you for your kind wisdom and your conﬁdence in appointing me, and I look forward to our paths
crossing again in the future.

Me Ke Aloha Pumehana,

Cc: Allan R. Landon, Chair Presley Pang, Secretary of the Board Dr. David McClain, President
