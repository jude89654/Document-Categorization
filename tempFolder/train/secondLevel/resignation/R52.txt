Dear Matthew Jones,

Please accept this letter as my two-week notice of resignation. My last day of work will be December 10,
201 l

I have been very satisÔ¨Åed working for The Grove at Statesboro; however, I have been accepted into Georgia
Tech University which will require me to relocate to Atlanta for the reminder of my matriculation in school. I
have enjoyed working with you and appreciate the opportunities

Have been given here.

I will give my best effort; remain enthusiastic and motivated through the end of my employment with The
Grove.

Sincerely,

Norman Gyamf
