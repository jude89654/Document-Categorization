Dear Mr. Tucker; 1am writing to announce my resignation from AlphaTech, effective as of March 24, 2014.
This was not an easy decision for me to make. The past eight years with AlphaTech have been very reward-
ing. I have enjoyed working with you and managing a successful team dedicated to a quality manufactured
product delivered on time and under budget. Thank you for the many great opportunities for growth and adâ€”
vancement that you have provided me.

I wish you and the company the very best.

Sincerely, ()/ ')/,

Devin Charles
