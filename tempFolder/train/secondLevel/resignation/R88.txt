PC Technician

Dear Human Resources

I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position as PC Technician for the Computers. My last day
of employment will be February 28.

I will be pursuing my career in Real Estate and look forward to the new direction of my career, even though I
will miss my job and Computers.

Thank you for the support and the opportunities that you have provided me during the last two years. I have
enjoyed my tenure with the company.

I wish you and the company all the best. I do hope our paths cross again in the future.

Sincerely,

Fernando Clide
