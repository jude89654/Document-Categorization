Dear Ms. Young.

1 would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position as a key data operator for the Turner
Agency, effective August 15.

This was not an easy decision to make, but I will be unable to meet the Ô¨Åfteen-hour per week work require-
ment because of personal issues.

Thank you for the opportunities and experiences you have provided me during my time of employment with
the company. 1 have grown personally and professionally because of this job, and 1 will miss you and my
coworkers, all of whom have made it a pleasure to work here.

Please let me know if I can be of any help during this transition.

Sincerely,

Steven Adams
