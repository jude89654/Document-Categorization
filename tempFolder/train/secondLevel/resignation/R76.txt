Dear Mr, Thomas,

It is with great sadness and anticipation that I offer my resignation as a loan officer for Tomato Bank. 1 know
that to move ahead in my career I will need to enhance my education with a Master's degree in Business Ad-
ministration. I will be taking two years off from my career to get my MBA and get back into the banking in-
dustry with a better position.

Your support and kindness over the past few years have been invaluable to me.I have learned a great deal
from you, especially how to be a successful branch manager. I wish you nothing but the best of success in
the future in everyone of your personal and professional endeavors.

I am willing to give a two-week‘s notice if that is what you require. I also understand that there will be a con-
siderable amount of paperwork to ﬁll out with human resources. If you need to contact me and discuss this
any further, please feel free to call me at 555-323-5533 or small meat ﬁankhortong emailcom. I appreciate
the opportunity to start my career at Tomato Bank and I will use what I have learned to further my career.
Sincerely Yours,

Frank E. Horton
