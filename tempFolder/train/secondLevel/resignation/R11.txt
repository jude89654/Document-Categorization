SUBJECT: Resignation

This will conﬁrm my resignation as an Associate at Dewey, C heatem & Howie, Attorneys at Law.

I have accepted a position as Special Counsel at a growing regional ﬁrm in Shreveport. I am looking forward
to my new position and the challenges that await me.

My last day of work will be December 20, 2005, which should allow me plenty of time to ﬁnish ongoing
projects and to turn over my position to my replacement. Please feel free to contact me at any time should
you have any questions regarding my past work, I hope that the transaction will go smoothly for everyone.
My experience with DCH has been very rewarding. I appreciate having had the opportunity to work for such
a ﬁne company. I wish you and the organization continued success.
