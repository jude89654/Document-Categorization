ABC Inc. Director of Human Resources 1234 Humberline Blvd. Toronto, ONAB8C9

Dicar Barbara Barbara,

Please accept this letter of notiﬁcation of my resignation from ABC Inc., effective November 1, 2004. I hope
the two weeks' notice is sufﬁcient

You have been a great manager and I have learned a great deal working with you. We have previously dis-
cussed my desire for additional responsibility and advancement, and have been able to find these opportuni-
ties in an outside organization. Thank you for all your help and guidance during my career at ABC Inc, I
have enjoyed working here for the past 5 years. The opportunity to begin my career in this company

has been wonderful

I appreciate your support in making this decision, and hope to stay in contact in the future.

Sincerely,

Resignation I
