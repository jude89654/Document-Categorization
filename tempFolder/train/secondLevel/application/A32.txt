Dear Hiring Committee,

I am a graphic designer that would love to have the opportunity to build my career Within your company,
I am searching for a position that will allow me to actively achieve my goals and contribute to your compa-
ny's growth. One of my goals is to deﬁne my skills and talents in the ﬁeld of design and photography,
Working for several years as a designer and photographer I've gained valuable experience, but have yet to
ﬁnd my speciﬁc roll in the design industry, if given the opportunity offer my excellent communication
skills, great ability to multitask, my need to organize and of course my talents as an artist. My salary re-
quirements are open for the time being. I am more concerned with building my experience within the right
company. So for now I am witing to work on minimal or no pay as long as there is the opportunity for
growth and later pay. You will ﬁnd my resume enclosed on the next page. I look forward to hearing from
you.

Sincerely,

JessicaB. Harrington
