Dear Sir or Madam.

While searching for opportunities to further my career in the culinary and catering field, 1 recently found
the position for Sous-Chef at the Resort & Spa. I am currently completing my internship for Culinary
Academy, and I would like to be considered for this position.

During my recent employment in Ô¨Åne dining establishments, I gained experience preparing and cooking
in a wood burning oven and producing over 20 dishes as a saute and pantry chef. I also maintained a quick
turnover rate while preparing 300-600 covers. At Everyday Country Club, I prepared hotline sandwiches
and meals and ensured customersatisfaction for large rental parties and events for the pool area. plan to
graduate from the Culinary Academy in May 2012 and believe I would be a great fit for your Resort &
Spa.

With a passion for culinary and catering and knowledge in working with business clients, I feel that I am
astrong match for the Sous-Chef position. I am excited at the possibility of cooperating with your staff and
clients at Resort & Spa. I have included a copy of my resume for you to review. I appreciate your consider-
ation, and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
