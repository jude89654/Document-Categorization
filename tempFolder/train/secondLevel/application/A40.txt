Dear Sir or Madam:

While searching for job opportunities, I recently found the position for the Motor Clothes Manager at your
Motorcycle Company. As a rider with a passion for clothes and several years of experience in sales and
management, I understand your customers and believe I would be a perfect ﬁt for this position.

In 2004 I managed the Home Decor store with duties that included hiring employees, ordering product,
maintaining inventory, managing the cash drawer, and creating store displays. As a sales associate at the
Shoe Store in Riverside, I assessed customer's needs and assisted their purchase decisions, as well as ex-
ceeded sales goals. During my employment at County Museum, I maintained records and bookkeeping,
created inventories and displays for the museum store, greeted customers and managed the museum store.
I also coordinated the training of volunteers and a work-study student, assisted the museum staff in collec-
tions, exhibits, education and special events. In 2002 completed an Associates Degree in Business Man-
agement with a Minor in Marketing. and I graduated with my Bachelor‘s Degree in Business Administra-
tion from University in August 2010.

I am excited at the possibility of working with Motorcycle Company employees and assisting customers
in making informed decisions for their Motor Clothes. I have included a copy of my resume and the appli-
cation for you to review. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Amelia Pond
