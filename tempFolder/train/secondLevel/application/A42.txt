I am Writing in reference to the position of Youth Counselor at the Sunnyside Group Home. I have the
pleasure of being acquainted with one of the Counselors on your staff, Eleanor Seville. Eleanor and did our
undergraduate work together at Sunnyville University, and have been in touch professionally and person-
ally since then. She let me know about the open position, and recommended that contact you.

have been working with at risk youths for ﬁfteen years, and have found the experience extremely reward-
ing. I have counseled young people with a variety of challenges, including family situations, drug use,
eating disorders, and behavioral issuesMy experience makes me well suited to help the residents at Sun-
nyside learn and growin a protected environment,

While I have experience in working with all ages, I believe that the adolescent population at your facility
would beneﬁt from the knowledge gained during the past five years while working in Student Services at
Sunnyville High School. I was recognized by the District as "Outstanding Teen Leader 2009" for the After
School Job Mentoring program developed and implemented with the cooperation of several local busi-
nesses.

Please take the time to consider my attached resume. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet
with you personally to discuss what have to bring to the position at Sunnyside at this time.

Regards,

Stephanie Smyles
