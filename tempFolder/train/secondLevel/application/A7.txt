Dear Mr. Smith:

This letter is in response to your ad in The Phoenix for an editor.

I have a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts. My experience includes work at: Advertising Inc. in New York,
an internship with That One Journal and freelance writing assignments for Your Community College.
My background includes extensive editorial, proofreading layout, and design experience, having served as
the editor of my high school yearbook and previously as a section editor and staff member. The yearbook
won ﬁrst place in the High School Press Conference for 1994. Most recently I completed a 32 page catalog
paste-up and layout project for Joenix Lab sales in Hillsboro.

As a temporary secretary word-processor, I am responsible for creating a wide variety of documents and
take great pleasure making sure each document looks good reads well and is enor—free.

My skills include organization and being detail-oriented, working well under pressure and on deadline,
working well with a variety of people, and having a great attitude. I'm looking for a creative, challenging
growth-oriented position and would like the opportunity to learn more about your company and the posi-
tion. What you need and what I can do soundlike a match! I look forward to hearing from you. Enclosed
are a few writing samples for your review.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe
