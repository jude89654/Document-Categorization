Vern Whittington University Recruiting Manager

Dallas Semiconductor 4401 South Beltwood Pkwy Dallas, TX 75244-3292

Dear Mr. Whittington.

I am Writing you to express my interest in becoming a VLSI design engineer with Dallas Semiconductor.
I will cam my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in August,
2008. My objective upon graduation is to become a successful VLSI design engineer in the semiconductor
industry.

During the Engineering Career Exposition in September 2008, Tiffany Oberlin, a Dallas Semiconductor
college stafﬁng coordinator, talked to me about career opportunities with Dallas Semiconductor. Her de-
scription of the company's wide range of products, especially touch memory for automatic identiﬁcation,
impressed me. I am very interested in becoming part of the VLSI design team working on this challenging
project.

As my enclosed resume explains, I have completed courses related to VLSI design, including digital
system design and reduced instruction set microprocessor design. I am also proﬁcient in several VLSI
design tools such as Synopsys and Workview. In addition, my three co-op tours with National Instruments
have demonstrated my ability to work with people and to apply my technical knowledge to practical tasks.
I am looking forward to discussing my qualiﬁcations with you. Please feel free to contact me either at
(512)111-2222 or at platapusGaussieu.edu Meanwhile, greatly appreciate your kind help and attention.
Sincerely,

Edward Damien
