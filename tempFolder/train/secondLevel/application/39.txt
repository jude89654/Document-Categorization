through technology in the House ofRepresentatives,
As we work to increase democracy in the People’s House‘ guaranteeing that the voices of
all the people are heard, we must also ensure that the people are able to hear us.
Thank you for all of the work that you have done to increase public discourse on
technology. accountability, and transparency issues. 1 look forward to working with you
during the 110‘" Congress.
