Dear Mr.S.Robin,

I am writing to introduce myself to you as a student of Nation School of Nursing (N SN). I'm responding
to your advertisement in the local Employment News for want of a certiﬁed nursing assistant CNA/PCA
for your emergency wards.

As you can see in the enclosed resume, I have a very strong academic background in nursing combined
with over six years work experience in health and medical care. My recent internship at Major Hospital,
New York, allowed me to further develop and strengthen my cormnunication skills. I believe that I could
make a signiﬁcant and valuable contribution in your ﬁrm.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my education and experience will be helpful to you. I
will be contacting you tomorrow morning on phone to talk about the possibility of arranging an interview.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

D. Jorge, Senior Student,

Nursing, ISC, Manhattan.
