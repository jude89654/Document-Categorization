Dear Carla,

I would like to apply for the position of Purchasing Manager as told by Laura Wilde who works as an Ac-
counts Executive in your organization. I am conﬁdent that you will ﬁnd my skills and qualiﬁcations rele-
vant to the job requirements,

I joined Nellie Corporation nine years ago as a Purchasing Manager, A major ﬁre broke out and the manu-
facturing unit was closed due to heavy losses. I lost my job but soon afterl got an offer from Frederick Inc
to work for their production plant, Both these jobs allowed me to utilize my skills and learn new concepts
that help in material testing and cutting production costs by purchasing from trusted vendors.

I am an excellent leader, communicator and a highly ﬂexible individual who can easily adjust with Chang-
ing environment and situations.

Please let me know if I am eligible for an interview by calling me on the telephone number 630-254-8197
or sending an e-mail on Leonardwig freerThail.com, I thank you for your time with an expectation to get
a prompt and positive response.
