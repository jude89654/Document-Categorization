Mr, John Force,
6 Beacon Street,
Boston, Mass,
Dear Sir:
This letter may be of some concern to you. I am not a man out of a job, but have what most men
would consider one that is ﬁrst-class. But I want to change, and if you can give me a little of your
time, I will tell you why and how that fact may interest you,
In a word, I have outgrown my present position, I want to get in touch with a business that is wide-
awake and progressive; one that will permit me to work out, unhampered, my ideas 011 ofﬁce
organization and managementiideas that are well»founded, conservative, and efﬁcient. My present
position does not give play to initiative
If you at this time happen to be looking for a man really to manage your ofﬁce, audit accounts, or
take charge of credits, my qualiﬁcations and business record will show you that I am able to act in
any or all of these capacities.
I have written with conﬁdence because I am sure of myself, and ifI undertake to direct your work,
you may be assured that it has a big chance of being successful,
If you so desire, I shall be glad to submit references in a personal interview.
Very tmly yours,
Clive Drew,
