Dear Sir or Madame

I wish to apply for the post of office assistant that was advertised in last Wednesday‘s Daily Star.

I left college last summer with Level One certiﬁcates in basic accounts and keyboard skills, then started
work part time in september at Longley's Garage in Bassingford and worked their for six months before
being made redundant. My job involved entering data into the computer system, ﬁling and photocopying.
I am now looking for a full-time job which offers me the chance to learn new computer skills and develop
my career

In my spare time enjoy swimming and going to the cinema with friends, have just pass my driving test and
my own transport.

I enclose a copy of my cv and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully

David Grey
