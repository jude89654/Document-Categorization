Dear Mr. Nelson:
1 am writing to apply for an Auditor Intern position at AlphaTech Contract Audits, which I learned about
through wholelottajobscom. You will find my resume enclosed. As my resume describes, I completed my
undergraduate studies at Edu-Tech University in Drytown, California. I am currently pursuing a Master in
Accountancy and Master in Business Administration at Ivy League University
I can claim signiﬁcant experience as an auditor, ﬁrst at Lyfetec Fund Services where I prepared mutual
funds for audit, and then at Human Development Resources where I performed audits on employee
timesheets. Additionally, I have completed several courses in auditing including Fraud and Forensics
Accounting and Principles ofAuditing and Practices.
I believe that my academic background along with my professional experiences provide a solid foundation
for your auditing position. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with
you in the near future.
Sincerely,
Maxwell Smart
