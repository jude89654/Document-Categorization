Dear Mr. Blake,

I have been following your restaurant‘s website for quite some time. I always wanted to be a part of your
management team. Your advertisement in the job portal has proved to be a golden opportunity for me to
show my capabilities. I hope you read my resume that I have enclosed with this letter that will give you de-
tailed information of my work experience and educational background.

I hold a master degree in management. I was trained to work as a restaurant manager and I ﬁnally got a job
with Phoenix House of Delicacy in Arizona. I worked there for the past ﬁve years and I am aware of the
duties and responsibilities involved. My key responsibilities in the organization were to make sure the res-
taurant functions properly and ensure that everything in the restaurant was inspected well. Working in a
restaurant involves a lot of staff problems and keeping the customers satisﬁed is another task that is really
important for the smooth running of the restaurant. Being in this ﬁeld for these many years has made me
capable of handling these problems smoothly. This is what I can offer your restaurant and I am sure you
will ﬁnd me worth the job,

It would really be kind of you if you could arrange a follow up interview wherein we can discuss the matter
in detail. I am available for an interview on any weekday. I can be contacted at (978)-201-3029 or e-mail

Sincerely Jason Parker
