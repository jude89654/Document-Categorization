Dear Sir or Madam,

Ref: Application for Sales Executive

1 am applying for the position of Sales Executive which was advertised in the Guardian Newspaper dated
6" February, 2009. I Would very much love to use the experience I gained working as a Sales representa-
tive to help DG Investment realize excellent clothing sales,

I recently graduated from the Copperbelt University with a diploma in Marketing. During my ﬁnal year at
the university, I worked with MTN as a sales representative for a period of four months. During those
months, I learnt valuable lessons on marketing strategies that could be very useﬁil to your company,

I developed excellent communication skills back at school, and I was used often to give speeches in behalf
of the school on important occasions,

I am a very social person and my cheerful disposition has made it easy for me to make a good number of
friends. This could be an added advantage as human interaction is what makes the sale industry a success.
Details of my qualifications are in the enclosed CW.

I am looking forward to meeting you as soon as I am considered to further discuss my qualiﬁcations and
experience. You may reach me at these two numbers: 09442233 or 09223311.

Yours faithfully,

George Mapenzi
