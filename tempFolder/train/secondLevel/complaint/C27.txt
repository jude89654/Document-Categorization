Complaint Letter to Bank Manager

22 October, 2014

Dear Mr. Krintine Stewart,

It is with regret I am writing this to you to notify you about my unpleasant banking experience in your
branch have an account with your bank for the past three months and my account number is 000347.555.
When joined the account your executive infomied me that I will receive my Debit card within 15 days of
opening the account. But till date have not received my Debit card. As you know it is very difﬁcult for me to
come to the bank physically to Withdraw money each time.

I have followed up with your staff and customer care department several times and nothing is materialized
till now. I am writing to you with deep regret as a last resort and this is not expected from a renowned bank
like yours.

I request you to kindly look into this matter and do the needﬁil so that can get my Debit card.

Thanks for your time and will appreciate an immediate action on this matter.

Sincerely

Max Rivers
