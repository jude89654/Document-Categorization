Dear Susan Paruch

We are writing to let you know the experience this area had with the Lowell wind turbines on Nov. 3rd and
4th.

Upon awakening at 6:00 AM on Nov. 3rd with the wind coming from the northwest and very little wind off
the mountain there was horrendous noise coming east from the project.

It projected out to a distance of over 3% miles and was constant from the early hours of the morning until
after 5:00 PM on the 4" of November.

One couple was awakened at 4:00AM on the moming of the 3rd

We decided to check with our neighbors and friends on the east side of the mountains to see what they had
witnessed.

The results are on the 4 pages enclosed. We only went to these few places but many more people are com-
plaining.

Sincerely,

Don and Shirley Nelson
