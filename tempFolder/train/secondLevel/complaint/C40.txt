Dear sir/madam.

This letter has surfaced out of sheer disgust resulted by the delivery service of Excellence Courier Service.
Couple of days back, I received a parcel which was

destined to me by my cousin through your courier service. The parcel has been delivered at least a week late
after having being promised to be delivered well in time. I can understand things can get disarrayed for some
reason or the other. But, it is your responsibility to put in a reasonable excuse for the long delay in the deliv-
ery. But, nothing of this sort was done.

Moreover, the parcel has been delivered in complete mess. I wish that you draw some inspiration from the
name of your service, Excellence Courier Service, and deliver what the name actually promises. I am expect-
ing a reply from your side for the poor service which was rendered to me. Hoping for a reasonable and a
quick reply.

Yours sincerely,

Ms. Scarlet
