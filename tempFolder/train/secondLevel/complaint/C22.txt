COMPLAINT LETTERS

Dear Sir/Madam

I am writing to inform you that the goods bought from your company have not been supplied correctly.

On 29 August 2013 visited your website and ordered a jigsaw puzzle with a personalized giﬁ card. It was de-
livered this moming and there are several problems regarding my purchase.

Firstly, according to your website, orders normally take two weeks, but in fact it took

over two months, arriving too late for me to offer it to my son as a birthday present. sent a number of emails
prior to his birthday, but they were never answered.

Secondly, it is not the size I had chosen. You have sent me a ISO-piece puzzle instead of the 500-piece one I
have ordered. This error put me in a tricky situation, as I had to deal with the rage of my ten-year-old son
who has felt treated as a quite a bit younger child.

The ﬁnal point I want to make concerns the gift card. You have mistaken the name of my son who is also
congratulated on his wedding.

As compensation for all these problems, I feel that should get my money back.

look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Yours faithfully,

Paloma. C.
