Dear Sir/Madam,

would like to make a complaint regarding my visit to Chessington World of Adventures on Saturday 11"
July 2015.

looking back at my photos of the day out, was annoyed to ﬁnd that a number of my family “selfie” snaps
featured an un-invited animal in the background.

understand that photo-bombing” is a popular practice these days but ﬁnd it absolutely absurd that this
should occur in every photo without my choice. I am convinced that the animals are trained to do this, and
if so ﬁnd it extremely inappropriate and an invasion of my family's privacy and mine as guests at your
resort.

Whilst understand that we are there to see and enjoy the animals, to not be able to capture at least one
family picture in the zoo area with no animal interruptions is quite upsetting.

look forward to your response to this complaint. As someone who values family days out, and the memo-
ries created, would hate to see another family's trip to your 200 ruined by these invasive animals.

Yours sincerely,

Vincent Go
