Re: Account no. 02795.01 0 Name on account: Mr F Jackson
1 am writing to complain about a penalty charge of £25 put on my sole current account.
On 10 June 2011, withdrew £150 from my sole current account to pay my credit card bill. At that time, the
balance on my current account was £181.62, received a bank statement dated 20 June which showed that
had been charged £25 for the transaction. I do not understand this as was not overdrawn on my account at
that time. believe this charge of £25 is wrong and would like this money to be reimbursed immediately. I
look forward to hearing from you. Please respond to my complaint within ten days.
Yours faithfully
Framciil J acksow
