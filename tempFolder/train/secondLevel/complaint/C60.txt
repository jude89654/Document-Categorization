My name is ABC.

I am writing this letter following my stay at your hotel, Hotel PQR, last week. This letter is in regard to the
poor level of Customer service with high customer dissatisfaction.

I opted for your property after checking your website which portrays a completely different picture, as com-
pared to reality. You claim to provide a lot many facilities which is not even available on your best rooms -
the super deluxe ones.

Right from the time of check-in, my experience had been the worst ever, understand that the way to the
resort from the main road cannot be your responsibility, but the way from the entrance at the main gate till
the reception is much worse than the road outside. The cart yres get stuck into the wetsoft mud that you have
laid. I actually could not understand if that is for the beautiﬁcation asper you people, or is that your lack of
maintenance.

There was nobody to welcome at the reception. It took 10 minutes for a room service boy to addressus and
another 15 minutes to call the receptionist And to the height of responsibility, the receptionists unaware of
the booking details, and the service boy took the baggage to the room without even informing us for the
same.

The room service has never attended on any of our calls either for the tea, meals or cleaning up the rooms.
The bathrooms and toilets were not cleaned before the check-in and had to drag the person along with me
after calling for the service some 10 times. Power-cuts another havoc. I didn't even dream of facing electrici-
ty Cut-off in such a 3 star claiming property. You have got electrical appliances which either wouldn't work
or there would be no electricity to operate.

I will deﬁnitely take up these issues, and will make sure that your property does not even get a single star.
Sincerely

Vincent Gogh
