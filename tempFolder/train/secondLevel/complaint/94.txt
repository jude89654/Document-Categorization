Dear Sir or Madam.

lsm wriling is bring is your ahenlion some issues wilh my local lrsin
service.

llske me aam lrsin lrom Manchee1er lo Liverpool every morning. This
week. rrry train has arrived al lessl 10 minules isle each day. and l
have been unable lo lind s seal due In overcrowding.

Passengers sre beooming increasingly lrusualed. I have seen several
people complain lo members ol your sis" Ina! lhe delays are making
lhem lale lor work, snd me overcrowding means lhal many ol us are
loroed lo sland in lhe cenlrsl sisle ol lhe lrsin lor lhe dumlian ol lhe
journey. This is extremely unoomlonsble.

I would like lo suggesl met you run a more regulsr service on the
Manchester lo Liverpool line. Anmher solulion would be is sdd an
extra carriage lo trains at peak limes in order In provide more spaoe.

l hope you will address mess oonoerns ss soon ss possible.

Vours ls'nhlully,

Paul Jones
