The Manager, Five Hearts Restaurant, PO. Box 002233, Lusaka, ZAMBIA.

Dear Sir,

Owing to the very poor service that I received on the lst of August at your restaurant, Five Hearts, I wish
to air my complaints. I was unhappy with the staffs attitude and also the quality of food.

Firstly, the staff portrayed a large amount of incompetence and a bad attitude towards customers. No one
attended to me for about ten minutes, and when the waiter Ô¨Ånally showed up, he showed a severe lack of
interest. He had to take my order three times, but even so, he still brought me the wrong food

Secondly, the service was very slow. It took nearly an hour for my food to be fully prepared. What made
matters worse was that after waiting for so long, the waiter brought the wrong food and he had to take it
back.

Thirdly, the food itself was of very poor quality. It was quite cold and tasteless. Immediately I reached
home, I suffered from very bad diarrhea which lasted for two days.

All these things considered, I feel I need to be compensated. In addition, I demand that you improve the
service at Five Hearts restaurant or shut it down as the service being offered is hazardous to the health of
your customers. If you do not do either of these, I will report it to the authorities myself

Please contact me at the address above or the following email address: dudeezedmailzm I would love to
hear from you as soon as possible.

yours F aithfully,

Dude Mude
