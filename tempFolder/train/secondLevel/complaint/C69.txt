Dear Neighbour

Unit 34

It is possible that you don't realise how intolerable your child's behaviour has become to a lot of people in the
complex. The screaming and whining is so loud that he can be heard at the entrance to the underground car-
park, throughout the car park and the entire pool area. We have been approached by other people living here,
including ones in the opposite wing, voicing their concern that there may be something wrong with your
child. We don't consider ourselves able to make a judgement on that.

Because of your child's behaviour we live, a lot of the time, with our doors and windows shut, our fans up
high and even the air conditioner on trying to drown out your child's whining. This has been going on for
some four months. Now he is riding (what we guess are toys on wheels), up and down and in and out of your
rooms, (your ﬂoors being our ceilings) and last Sunday night (14"June) the constant sound coming down
through our ceilings was like a vehicle having lost it tyres and being driven on its rims.

We empathise with single parenthood and think you an extremely patient and tolerant father but our patience
and tolerance have been sorely tested and come to an end. We would prefer not to complain to the manage-
ment and hope you can ﬁx the problem before we are forced to.

Sincerely

Chris & Denise Unit 17
