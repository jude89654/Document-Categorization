FLESTA BLACKOUT ROLLER SHADE

Dear Mr Hampton,

I am writing to complain about the faulty installation of the above blackout shade to my bedroom window,
Mr Brand from your company came to my house to ﬁt the shade on Monday, 29 March. That same evening,
I discovered the mechanism was not working and that it was impossible either to raise or to lower the shade.
I phoned your company the following morning and Mr Brand returned three days later to repair the shade.
However, although the shade worked for the ﬁrst few days after his visit, it then j ammed once more. When
Iphoned again on 6 April to report this fault I was told that no one would be available to visit me for two
weeks,

As I regulme work nights, and this shade is the only means of blocking outday light, it is vital that it is func-
tioning properly so that I can sleep during the day, I therefore would appreciate it if you would ensure that
someone returns to replace the shade by the end of the week.

Sincerely yours,

Patrick Bowles
