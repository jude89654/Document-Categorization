Dear Mr. MomC ek,

I am sending this letter by registered mail because I have been unable to Contact you Via telephone. On June
3 you contracted to build me a six-foot high Cedar fence, With an additional four feet of stake underground.
The

Completion date Was July 1, and the agreed price Was $800. (A copy of the Contract is attached)

My quarrel is not that you didnâ€˜t start the fence until July I, or that the construction ran $300 over the agreed
price. I am objecting to the fact that have since discovered the fence extends only two feet underground, not
the four feet required by village code, and that it was built with Wood untreated for Outdoor use,

I would like you to refund the $300 paid over the agreed price, which is what

it Will cost to have the Wooden fence treated and restaked. If I do not receive a check in that amount by Sep-
tember 5, I will turn the matter over to my

attorney and report your company to the Better Business Bureau. It will be far costlier if you were ordered to
replace the fence or refund all my money. Regards,

(signature)

Joe Smith
