Dear Mr. Chiba,

This letter is a formal complaint Over the conduct of one of my colleagues in the sales department, Mr.
Farooq Gandhi. He has consistently abused me emotionally for one month now and can no longer tolerate
his harsh comments and disrespectful manner towards me. I have been a sales staff for ﬁve years now and
this is the first time that have encountered a colleague with such brashness. I have already taked to him and
my team leader about the matter but he has not followed the agreements we have come up with to improve
his manner, My work is already being affected because of Mr. Gandhi‘s

behavior and cannot concentrate well on my work

Please look into this matter accordingly. I am willing to undergo the due process for the resolution of this
problem.

Respectfully,

Ken Chan
