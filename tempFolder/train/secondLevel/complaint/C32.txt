Subject: Easylron Electric Iron (Model No. 2279)

Dear Sir or Madam:

I wish to express my dissatisfaction with the above iron, which I purchased from The Electrical Store in
Newtown on 10 October, 2015. On using it for the Ô¨Årst time, I found that the temperature control was faulty;
it was not possible to set it for any temperature apart from the highest, for cotton.

When I attempted to return the iron to the store, the cashier said that the store was unable to replace it or offer
me a refund but advised me that it could be sent away for repair. As 1 need an iron on a daily basis, and it
was not clear how long a repair would take, this option was unsatisfactory. As the iron clearly does not func-
tion as it should and therefore does not comply with the legal standards of product quality, I am writing to
you to ask for a full refund of the E3599 retail price,

I look forward to hearing from you within the next two weeks.

Yours truly,

Jenny Hawkins
