Ref. Poor Facilities

Dear Mr, Olsen.

This is to inform you regarding the inconvenience faced by the employees because of poor working condi-
tions.

Our repeated verbal complaints about the inadequate air conditioning units in our Department have yielded
no results.

I am sure you can understand how this can affect the work productivity of the team.
I request you to kindly look into the problem immediately and take suitable action.
Thanking You,

Sincerely,

Tony McDonald
