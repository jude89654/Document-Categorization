DearSir/Madam,

I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with your service.

Two weeks ago I ordered a puzzle of the map of Madrid with 500 pieces According to your website, deliv-
ery would take two weeks, however, it took a month. When I ﬁnally received the puzzle, a week later to my
husband's birthday, it wasn‘t as I ordered. It came incomplete (it only had 488 pieces), and the map was abso-
lutely distorted That wasn't Madrid at all Imagine when I gave the gift to my husband, days after his birth-
day and incomplete.

Added to all this, the deliveryman was really rude to us. He treated us as mean people because we refused to
pay him anything for the delivery service. It was stated on your website that delivery was included in the
cost.

I was told to write a letter of Complaint if I had any problem, so here it is. Also, I was informed that I would
have a full refund if I was not satisﬁed, so that is why I am writing. We expect a letter of explanation as well
as a full refund of our money.

I look forward to hearing from you within the next week.

Yours faithfully,

Joaquina
