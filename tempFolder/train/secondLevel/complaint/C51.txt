Dear Sir.

I am a resident of Boston city. On 25 April 2010 I bought a laptop with serial no. 36729 from Messer Bright
and Jonson electronics for $700. The company gave all year warranty and 6 months money back guaranty. I
was told that in case of any trouble with the piece all my money will be given back to me with immediate ef-
fector if I wish I can choose another model After all these clauses I have purchased the laptop but since the
very ﬁrst day it was troublesome for me. The processor was very slow and it was taking a lot of time even in
a smallest action of copy pasting. Not only this but the hard disk also crashed and all my important data were
lost,

I complaint for it and even my repeated requests for a replacement have fallen on deaf ears. I had written half
a dozen letters to the Manager of the ﬁlm All that I got was a reassurance from them that they are looking
into the matter. I have been running from pillar to post for last 8 days.

And now I am tired of it, therefore request you to kindly accept my complaint letter and ﬁle a case against
the above mentioned ﬁrm I am enclosing all the necessary documents like the cash memo, the guarantee
card and the various letters that I had written to the firms Manager, along with their replies.

I am looking for a favorable response.

Thank You.

Sincerely,

George Jacob
