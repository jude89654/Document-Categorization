Dear Sir,

Re: Delegation Request - Barking Dogs

1 would like to acknowledge receipt of your correspondence received November 29 regarding the above.
As previously stated in my October 19" letter should you wish to address what concerns you have with
regard to the dog control bylaw regarding barking dogs in your neighborhood you are requested to write a
letter directly to Chair Hobson outlining speciﬁcs in order that these issues may be reviewed on an individ-
ual basis. I am aware that bylaw enforcement is responding to your numerous complaints regarding bark-
ing dogs as staff resources are available.

As you will note, the Regional Board receives copies of your delegation requests and correspondence and
therefore are aware of your opinions. Should you choose not to respond as we have requested that is your
right to do so.

The Board‘s Delegation Policy is being followed in all instances.

Yours truly,

Harold Reay Chief Administrative Ofﬁcer
