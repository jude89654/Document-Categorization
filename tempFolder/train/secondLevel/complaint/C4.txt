Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to: complaining about the astonishing RMS Titanic disaster. Because I lost my money my
home everything. I am Fredrick William Bannett was in the Titanic boiler room.

I will hopefully resave a new job, but if not will be speaking to my lawyers and take this to court! I want
some clothes and somewhere to stay.

When you another ship count me in because I still won't a job from you. In addition I need some money be-
cause my mother is ill how would you feel if your mum was ill and no body gave you money would you?
Find me a job as soon as possible.

Oh by the way I hope you get sewed and I didn't tell you how much I want including my job money 5.00
and including How much I should have got $500.

Yours sincerely

Fredrick William Bamott
