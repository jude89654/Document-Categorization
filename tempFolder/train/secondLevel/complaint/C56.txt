Letter of complaint for poor service

Sample letter: Complaint of poor service

Webster Comers, Mo, April 24, 1920.

Messrs. Peter Swarm Co.,

Kansas City, Mo.

Gentlemen: Attention Mr. Albert Brann.

On Tuesday last I bought at your store two boys' wash suits This is Monday and the goods have not yet been
delivered. The delay has caused me great inconvenience. If this were the ﬁrst time that you had been careless
in sending out orders I should feel less impatient, but three times within the last four weeks I have been simi-
larly annoyed.

On March 3rd I sent back my bill for correction, goods returned not having been credited to my account. On
March 15th the bill was again sent in its original form with a "please remit." I again wrote, making explana—
tion, but to date have received no reply. If I must be constantly annoyed in this manner, I shall have to close
my account.

Very truly yours, Helena Young Tremp.

(Mrs. Kenneth Tremp)
