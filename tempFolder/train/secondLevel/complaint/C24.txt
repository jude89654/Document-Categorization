Dear Mr. Miguel,

I am a long time customer of your company and was very upset when recently purchased one of your prod-
ucts only to have it be defective. While this is a Ô¨Årst for me when dealing with your company, I am definitely
not happy about it and would like you to handle this complaint swiftly.

Whenever have purchased items from you in the past, have received high quality merchandise that 1 am
proud to use. This time, however, I am appalled at the quality and wonder how you could allow such a prod-
uct to hit shelves at all.

I would hope that this is simply a one-time thing, as do not want to believe that this company has gone
downhill so quickly. A that I am asking in this case is to receive my money back, as do not believe that this
product was delivered to me as promised.

I am really not trying to be difficult, but it seems as though too many companies are now offering substand-
ard products and expecting to get away with this, I, however, will not stand for spending my hard-eamed
money on an item, only to have it not only be defective, but not even be the same item that thought was pur-
chasing.

I really do not want to be nude, but the quality of this product is nowhere near what would expect from a
company like yours and believe that this should be dealt with as soon as possible.

Yours Faithfully,

Chris Jonas
