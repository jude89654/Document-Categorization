Complaint Letter to Apartment Manager About Noise

March 21, 2013

Pauline Mitchell,

Owner

Hudson Apartments F.O.BOX 332 Sioux City, IA51 123

Dear Ms. Mitchell:

1 live in your 256 Davis/Ehnwood building, apartment #354. As I write this letter, the din from my upstairs
neighbors is all but drowning out the sound of the typewriter, You must be aware that the Choms (apt. 454)
have six children, all under the age of 12, in a one-bedroom apartment.

I have been a tenant in your building for six years now, and have never had cause to complain about my
neighbors before. But the kind of commotion in the C hom apartment disrupts the lives of everyone who lives
below, above, or to either side of them, The noise is virtually constant from six in the morning to ten or
eleven at night. The children run up and down the hallways at all hours, use the Wheelchair ramp as a play-
ground, and jump so hard on their ﬂoors that the plaster is ﬂaking off my ceiling. More seriously, the Crowd-
ing of eight people in a one-bedroom apartment violates our local zoning laws.

I am not against children in apartment buildings, just against packing so many of them into one small space.
If you cannot arrange other accommodations for this family, I shall be forced to report you to the local
zoning board. Other tenants have talked to are also Willing to take this step. Please see what you can do to
rectify this situation and let the rest of us get some sleep. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ashoka Nalamwar
