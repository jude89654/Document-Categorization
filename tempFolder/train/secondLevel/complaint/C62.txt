Mr. Menlo Ortega

Director of investment Funds

Dear Sir,

By the following letter of complaint, I would like to express my tin-satisfaction with the treatment received
at the branch, by the operator Francisco Garza who kindly attended at Ô¨Årst, until the conversation took worse
paths and ending with an assault on my wife.

We have not made any complaint to the police and we prefer that this regrettable incident is settled in a
friendly manner. But convey my deep un-satisfaction with what happened and propose a meeting with you
and Mr. Francisco to fix everything in da civilized manner.

No other tasks,

Yours truly,

Rodrigo Diaz
