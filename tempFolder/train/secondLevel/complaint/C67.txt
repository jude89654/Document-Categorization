Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention some issues with my local train service.

I take the 8am train from Manchester to Liverpool every morning. This week, my train has arrived at least 10
minutes late each day, and have been unable to Ô¨Ånd a seat due to overcrowding

Passengers are becoming increasingly frustrated. I have seen several people complain to members of your
staff that the delays are making them late for work, and the overcrowding means that many of us are forced
to stand in the central aisle of the train for the duration of the journey. This is extremely uncomfortable.

I would like to suggest that you run a more regular service on the Manchester to Liverpool line. Another
solution would be to add an extra carriage to trains at peak times in order to provide more space. I hope you
will address these concerns as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,

Paul Jones
