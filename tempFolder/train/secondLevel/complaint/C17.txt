Dear Mr. Ghandi,

I Want to air my Complaint Over the delivery of the products purchased from your store last week. I pur-
chased ten units of microwave Owens from your store which was supposed to be delivered last week. The
ﬁrst delivery arrived the day after purchased the items but only ﬁve units were delivered to my home. The
delivery man gave me a letter from the sales department explaining that the additional ﬁve units will be de-
livered within the week since new stocks were still being ordered from the supplier. However, the week has
come and gone and the remaining units have not yet been delivered from me.

hope you look into this matter immediately and acton my complaint to avoid further damage. I may be
forced to take legal action if you fail to respond to my letter soon.

Sincerely,

Ms. Goo Garlanka
