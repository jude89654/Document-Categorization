Customer Service Representative

Efﬁcient Electronics

Dear Mr. Baker.

I Write to you with regard to the quality of the laptop which purchased from your company at your branch in
town‘ I bought the laptop which was sold on sale last week. Despite the item being sold at a lower price,
your sales staff at the time, Mr. Joseph McDonald, assured me that the item is still fully functional and has no
defects. I was satisﬁed with my purchase at the time.

After only a week of use, however, the laptop battery is already starting to malfunction.

I have to keep the laptop connected to an electricity source and thus could not use the equipment outside my
home or ofﬁce. Since the item has a one year warranty, please

replace the laptop immediately I have attached the receipt and warranty card for your reference

Sincerely,

Edwin Hasselfhoff
