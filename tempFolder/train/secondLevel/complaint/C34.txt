Re:Holiday reference number CT2118M

Dear Mr Black:

Following our telephone conversation earlier today, lam writing to give details of my dissatisfaction with my
stay at the New Hotel, Los Christianos, Tenerife, on 1018 August 2010, which booked with your company
for me and my family.

My central complaint is that the hotel fell far short of the description in die brochure. We had booked two
double suites, in rooms 213 and 214. Although the rooms were billed as four-star accommodation, they were
very cramped, and the furnishings were worn and dirty. In addition, the shower in room 213 did not work.
The hotel's grounds, described in the brochure as "pleasant, tranquil, and spacious, were in fact bordered on
two sides by a very busy main road. The swimming pool was closed the entire week for repairs.

When we spoke to your representative, Tracey Mills, she promised to try to get the shower ﬁxed, but this
took an unacceptably long time to happen-three days from when we ﬁrst complained. I asked her to ﬁll out
an accommodation report form detailing these issues and enclose a copy for your information, together with
photos of the bedrooms and the hotel grounds.

As stated in my telephone call, I feel that we are due a full refund for this hotel stay as it failed to meet the
description in the brochure, and it ruined our holiday. I look forward to hearing from you within the next two
weeks.

Sincerely yours,

Maria Johnson
