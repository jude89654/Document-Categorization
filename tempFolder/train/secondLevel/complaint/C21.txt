South London. Date: 30.6.14

Subject. Customer service complaint letter

Dear Mr. Penn,

I have been a loyal customer of your shoe Center in South London for the past five years. However am Writ-
ing this letter to ﬁle a complaint against the unsatisfactory services that the store has been providing for the
past few months.

From the past few visits, feel that the attendees present in the shop ﬁrstly ignore the Customers and then
behave rudely when they ask for any item. lvisited your shoe store on 25 June, 2014 and found myself
standing for ten minutes before one of the attendees approached me to know my needs, When asked him for
the item needed, he showed me one of two varieties which did not like. Soon after my denial to these varie-
ties, he started getting annoyed and spoke rudely.

I have been Visiting your shop for many years but have never experienced such a behavior from your previ-
ous staff. Kindly pay attention to my complaint and look into this matter as

soon as possible as this kind of behavior is not at all acceptable.

Sincerely,

Sarah Parker.
