Dear Ms. Stones,

With due respect will like to bring to your attention the rude and incompetent behavior of Mr. Albert Franco.
His attitude toward the junior is totally unprofessional. He has been treating his juniors in the way totally un-
acceptable.

It is due to all this we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to work along with him. He also exploiting his positions for his person-
al gains and even threatened many colleagues and juniors. The reports made by him also have many irregu-
larities and facts have been misquoted to make the reports look one sided. His reports and memos for
promotion are also biased.

It's our humble request that kindly look into the matter and take some serious steps in this regard to improve
his conduct and behavior.

Thanking you

Sincerely,

Jennifer Chan
