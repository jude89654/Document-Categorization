Dear Sir,

We regret to inform you that one of the cases of your consignment arrived in badly damaged condition. It is
FBG/46 containing 100 doz. “Onset". The lid was broken and the case with it content crushed. It looks as if
some very heavy cargo had fallen on it. We have examined the boxes and ﬁnd that about 46 dozen are in an
unsaleable condition, We pointed out the damage when taking delivery and have endorsed our receipt "1
case severely damaged".

We assume that you are taking the matter up from your end as insurance had been affected by you.

Yours faithfully

Hammam Abdurrahman
