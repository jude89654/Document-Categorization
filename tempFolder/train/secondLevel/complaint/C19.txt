Subject: Complaint of faulty auto parts

Dear John,

I recently bought a white colored car of the Stylus model from one of your showrooms in Los Angeles. I had
a very high expectation from it, but to my disappointment, the car was not up to the mark spoke to some of
my friends who own the same car and realized that the problems were only with my car and not the model
and make of the car. Firstly, the windows were not opening completely, which I thought was done as per the
styling of the car.

Also, the engine made a peculiar noise, which was not expected by me. I would also like to point out that the
upholstery used in the front seats and back seats is similar but not exactly the same. I had checked this out
with my friends who conﬁrmed that it was a mistake on behalf of the manufacturers.

I have bought this car with a lot emotions attached and thus would like you to take all necessary action so
that these problems are rectiﬁed at the earliest. Please ensure that I do not have any more complaints regard-
ing the car in future as well.

Thanking You

Jason Bingham
