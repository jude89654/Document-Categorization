MARIA SUSANA PORTELA

Municipal Mayor

Florencia — Caqueta

Dear Ms. Portela,

In the capacity of citizens of the city of Florencia, let us draw your attention to the unhygienic sanitary condi-
tion prevailing in the locality, which need the immediate attention of the Municipality.

The stagnant waters, the foul smelling drains and the un-removed garbage, have made life very miserable for
the residents. Heaps of garbage lies near the dustbins. Even the dust-bins remain full to capacity. They are
not cleared for weeks. The stagnant pools of water have become a breeding place for ﬂies and mosquitoes.
Stray dogs and pigs surround the dustbins. An epidemic is expected any moment due to the unhygienic con-
ditions here,

Complaints lodged at the local office proved futile. The situation still remains the same. If immediate steps
are not taken to improve the sanitary conditions of the city, the life of the residents will be in danger.

Kindly take necessary steps to improve the situation of citizens.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully, students at the University of the Amazonia
