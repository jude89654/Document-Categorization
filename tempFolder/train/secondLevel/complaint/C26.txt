Complaint Letter For Insurance Agent

Dear Mr. Dave Williams

I am writing this complain letter against my insurance agent who sold me the inappropriate car policy to me
based on wrongly presented facts. My car insurance policy number is 00123444,

When your agent Mr. Max Brown approached me with this policy, he had told me that this insurance will
also cover me and my family who is using the car.But recently when called the company regarding a minor
accident occurred on September 12" when my wife was driving the car, was told that my claim was rejected
because the policy didn't cover my wife.

I am sure the agent had made a mistake of not arranging the appropriate policy as per my requirement. 1
would expect you to look into this matter and take the necessary action on this so that I can claim my insur-
ance.

look forward to your response as early as possible.

Sincerely,

Signature

Austin Jones
