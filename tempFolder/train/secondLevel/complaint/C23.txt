Dear Sir John,

I recently purchased your product through a local retailer and was very upset to ﬁnd that it did not work as
expect have been a very loyal customer of your company for a number of years and this is certainly not the
quality that have come to expect from you,

Under normal circumstances, would simply return this item to the store, but was told that this is not an
option, since the item had already been used. Well, of course the item had already been used, as there would
be no other way for me to learn that it was defective.

As stated previously, have come to expect much more from your products and, therefore, this has been very
upsetting for me. If you wish to return to the top of this industry, you will deﬁnitely have to improve the
quality of your products, as this simply will not cut it in the future

I do not believe that I am asking for much in return for my time and effort, as a want is my money back or to
have this product replaced with one that works properly, I will gladly retum the defective item to you, should
you senda postage-prepaid box to my house

I do not feel that 1 am being unreasonable with my request,

Sincerely,

Grace Bond
