Re: Excessive Noise

Dear Johnny and Mary,

It has been reported, and documented, that excessive noise and disturbance has been coming from your
rented premises at 1234 Elm, Unit 52, (describe, giving times/details). It is absolutely essential that all resi-
dents respect the right to quiet enjoyment of their neighbors, a right that is protected by law and by the coveâ€”
nants of your lease.

I ask that you respect the concerns of your neighbors and control the noise levels generated within your
rented premises. If you do not do so, you will be in violation of your lease, and with local law, but more im-
portantly, you will be disrupting the quiet enjoyment of your neighbors.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Justin Dahood
