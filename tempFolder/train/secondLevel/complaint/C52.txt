Editing and proofreading a letter of complaint

What do you think of this letter of complaint? is everything included? Are there any mistakes?

14 Wood Lane Emscott Wardley Berkshire 21 May 2011 The Manager Bombay Tiger Restaurant South Lea
Wardley Berkshire Dear Sir

I am writing to complain about the meal had at your restaurant The Bombay Tiger in South Lea last thursday
night.

The service was very slow and when the meal Ô¨Ånally arrived the curry was Cold. When asked for the food to
be took back and reheated the Waiter was rude and shouted at me and my frie\nds. In fact he told me
should've ordered something different. Finally when the bill came there was a mistake on it - we was
charged twice for our desert.

If this is typical of your usual standard of service i for one won't be coming back in a rush

Yours faithfully

Stan Gooding
