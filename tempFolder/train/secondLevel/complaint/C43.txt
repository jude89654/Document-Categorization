Dear Sir/Madam

L am writing today to complain of the poor service received from your company on June 12, 2008. was visit-
ed by a representative of That Awful Company, Mr. Madman, at my home on that day.

Mr. Madman was one hour late for his appointment and offered nothing by way of apology when he arrived
at noon. Your representative did not remove his muddy shoes upon entering my house, and consequently left
a trail of dirt in the hallway. Mr. Madman then proceeded to present a range of products to me that I had spe-
ciﬁcally told his assistant by telephone I was not interested in. I repeatedly tried to ask your representative
about the products that were of interest to me, but he refused to deal with my questions. We ended our meet-
ing after 25 minutes without either of us having accomplished anything.

I am most annoyed that wasted a morning (and half a day's vacation) waiting for Mr. Madman to show up.
My impression of That Awful Company has been tarnished, and I am now concemed about how my existing
business is being managed by your ﬁrm. Furthermore, Mr. Madrnan's inability to remove his muddy shoes
has meant that have had to engage the services, and incur the expense of a professional carpet cleaner

I trust this is not the way That Awful Company wishes to conduct business with valued customers I have
been with you since the company was founded and have never encountered such treatment before. I would
welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to eam of how you propose to prevent a similar situa-
tion from recurring-look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Vern Angle
