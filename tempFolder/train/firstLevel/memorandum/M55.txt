MEMORANDUM DATE: September 29, 2011

TO: Florida Department of Education RE: FAUS Teacher Evaluation System

This letter is to verify that FAUS' Teacher Evaluation System was developed and revised by FAUS'
Teacher Evaluation and Appraisal Team. This team consists of representatives from FAUS'adminis-
trative team, faculty, and teachers' union. This system will be implemented beginning with the
2011-12 academic year. While school board approval is not required, collective bargaining sessions
between the teachers' union (United Faculty of Florida) and the respective ofÔ¨Åcials from Florida At-
lantic University (Board of Trustees) are delayed pending legal interpretations of the recent statuto-
ry language as applied to university school faculty and permanent status, which are anticipated
soon.
