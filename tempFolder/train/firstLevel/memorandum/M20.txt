MEMORANDUM

Date: March 22, 1999

To: Steve Francis and Bill Young

From: R. Nowinski, D. Francis, and P. Berman

Subject: Executive Positions, Reporting Relationships, and Executive Compensation

During the past two years the Company initiated two Phase III trials for AIDSVAX in the US. and in
Thailand. Development of a third AIDSVAX product, for HIV subtypes A, D, and C viruses in Africa
and Asia, will soon be underway. We also have initiated close working relationships with the CDC,
NIAID and PMC. We have moved into corporate headquarters in Brisbane and we will occupy our
new laboratories this Spring.

Since the origin of the Company, we have raised $42.3 million privately; we are now considering an
IPO that could net an additional $36 million. We have been granted $12.6 million by goverrnnent
agencies over the next 4 years, and we have grant applications pending for over $20 million.

We have moved to 50 employees, with management requirements that now out-strip our current exec-
utive group. We recommend that, with this memorandum, we hire additional positions and eliminate
redundant part-time activities for the next stage of corporate development. We also recommend that
the executive team adopt a uniform compensation system that is within the general range of the Bio-
tech industry.
