MEMORANDUM

TO: All County Prosecutors
FROM: Peter C. Harvey First Assistant Attorney General
DATE: December 2, 2002
SUBJECT: Directive Concerning the Use of Grand Jury Subpoenas to Compel Hospitals to
Produce Medical Records
1. Introduction and Overview.
For many years, county prosecutors have routinely used grand jury subpoenas to obtain medical re-
cords from hospitals. Recently, some hospitals have Challenged the authority of a prosecutor to gain
access to hospital records without ﬁrst obtaining written authorization from the patient to whom
medical services were provided. This issue was first raised in Passaic County in the case of State v.
Hendley. In that matter, a hospital ﬁled a motion to quash a grandjury subpoena. The Passaic
County Assignment Judge, the Honorable Robert J. Passero, A.J.S.C., rejected the hospital's motion
and ruled in an unreported decision that the broad powers of the grand jury to investigate crimes out-
weighs the hospital‘s assertion of the patientphysician privilege codiﬁed at N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-22.l et
seq. and N.J.R.E. 506.
The Division of Criminal Justice and the Division of Law have conducted extensive research on this
matter and have determined that under State and Federal law, neither the patient-physician privilege
nor any other principle of law precludes a prosecutor from using a grand. j ury subpoena to compel
the production of medical records that are relevant to a criminal investigation. Accordingly, except
as otherwise noted in S3, infra, a hospital must comply with a grand jury subpoena calling for the
production of medical records.
