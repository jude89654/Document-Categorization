RE: Responding to Child Welfare Concerns
Recently questions have arisen regarding a person‘s obligation in respect to reporting suspected
‘Child Welfare Concerns”. For your information, and action if necessary, attached is:
. An excerpt from the Child, Family and Community Service Act stating what you are ‘
required by law to do.
- A booklet providing guidance on ‘Your Role in Knowing When and What to Report”.
0 The booklet concludes with the direction:
If you think a child is being abused or neglected, you have the legal
duty to report your concern to your local child welfare worker. There is
contact information available on page 12.
If it is after hours or you are not sure who to call, phone the Helpline for
Children at 310-1234 at any time of the day or night. The Helpline call is
free. You do not need an area code and you do not have to give your
name.
If the child is in immediate danger, call 9-1-1 or your local police.
If you have any doubts what so ever regarding your obligation, the LISA office and the undersigned
will direct you to report your information, as required by the legislation, to the appropriate agency.
