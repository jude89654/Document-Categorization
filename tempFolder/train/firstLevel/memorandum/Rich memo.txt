MEMORANDUM
TO: COGCC Commissioners
FROM: Rich Griebling M
DATE: June 25, 2004
SUBJECT: Coordination with the Southern Ute lndian Tribe and Red
Willow Regarding the Regulation of Oil and Gas
Operations
The purpose of this memo is to summarize the coordination between the
COGCC and the Southern Ute lndian Tribe (SUIT) and Red Willow with respect
to the regulation of oil and gas operations in Colorado.
The SUIT status as a sovereign nation and the sometimes complex and often
diverse ownership of surface and mineral property rights necessitate coordination
in orderto promote the responsible development of oil and gas resources within
the exterior boundary of the Southern Ute lndian Reservation. When Red Willow
acts as an operator outside of the Southern Ute Reservation (eg. in Weld or
Routt Counties) they function as other oil and gas operators with respect to
COGCC regulation
The annual value of Colorado oil and gas production is estimated to exceed $5
Billion. Over 80% of that is from natural gas. About one half of the State’s gas
production comes from La Plata County.
As you know, the Southern Ute lndian Reservation is located in La Plata and
Archuleta Counties and occupies most of the Colorado portion of the San Juan
sedimentary basin that is being developed for natural gas production. Based on
statistics for 2002 operated Colorado gas production, Fled Willow ranked
seventh. Data for non-operated production is not reported. A rough estimate is
that if non-operated production were included, Red Willow would rank second.
The following provide examples of coordination with respect to oil and gas
development on the Southern Ute lndian Reservation:
. Regulation: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) generally regulates oil
and gas operations on Tribal Lands and performs many of the functions that
