Subject: Update on GMPC Housing Activities

The attached diagram identiﬁes ﬁve different activities related to housing that are currently being
led by the GMPC. At the GMPC meeting on the 27" you will receive information on the status of
each of these activities.

With the exception of the "jobs housing distribution" for which policy development will begin next
year, the purpose of all of these efforts is to develop housing tools that local jurisdictions can use to
successfully implement local housing plans.

Also attached to this memo for your review are:

- A proposed GMPC strategy for addressing jobs housing distribution issues over the next two
years in response to changes in the state's growth forecast for the region.

- A preliminary list of issue areas, identiﬁed by housing stakeholders, where potential model prac-
tices may be developed and brought to the GMPC for discussion.
