Re. Ervisioning a Corporate Citizenship Program for Awanade

While corporate social responsibility programs (CSRs) have existed for marty years, an increasing
number of companies have implemented these programs in the last decade. These organizations rec-
ognize that CSR programs improve their: (1) reputation, (ii) competitive advantage, (ii) ability to
retain and attract current and prospective employees, clients, customers or users, and (iv) relation-
ships with suppliers, governments, and communities. Importantly, CSR programs foster cooperation
and team spirit Within an organization's workforce, reinforce the messaging behind an organiza-
tion's code of conduct, and empower a company's employees to take an ownership stake in the well-
being of their community and their company.

To date, industry leaders, including technology giants like Intel and Microsoft, have established
some of the world's most recognizable CSR programs. But companies in all industries and of all
sizes have created successful and impactful CSR programs. Accordingly, smaller professional ser-
vice providers like Awarade can make substantive contributions to their communities through tar-
geted initiatives that leverage core strengths and values of the organization. By evaluating the CSR
programs of some of Awanade's competitors as well as the programs of other organizations that are
similar in size and earnings to Avanade, Avarade can "cherry pick" from these CSR programs to
construct its own customized CSR program that reï¬‚ects its culture and values.

This memo should be reviewed in tandem with the Corporate Citizenship Comparison excel spread-
sheet previously provided.
