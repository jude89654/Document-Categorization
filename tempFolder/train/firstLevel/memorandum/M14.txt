LEGAL MEMORANDUM 01-254

TO: ALL JUSTICES OF THE PEACE

FROM: PATRICIA W. GRIFFIN CHIEF MAGISTRATE

DATE: FEBRUARY 15, 2001

RE: STALKER LIDAR

Attached is the decision in State v. Jarwan' in which the Superior Court applied the ﬁve prong test
for the admission of novel scientiﬁc evidence to ﬁnd that speed readings from a Stalker Lidar unit
are admissible with proper foundation testimony from a trained Operator. Although the Court had
previously ruled on devices using laser principles, this was the ﬁrst case to address the admissibility
of the Stalker Lidar device. (The Stalker radar discussed in Legal Memorandum 97-223 (April 16,
1997) is not a laser device.)

The Stalker Lidar device is a laser speed detection device and operates using two processes. The ﬁrst
process is lidar, which uses laser pulses to measure distance by beaming a series of laser pulses at a
target. The second process is an algorithm known as the "Least-Squares Curve Fit” which calculates
the speed of the target using the information gathered by the lidar process.

The Superior Court found that testimony regarding the results of the Stalker Lidar device are admis-
sible provided a trained and certiﬁed operator establishes the proper minimum foundation for admis-
sibility. This minimum foundation is:

" Del. Super, 2000 WL331 13846, Ridgely, P.J. (Dec. 8, 2000).

In determining whether new or novel scientiﬁc evidence may be admitted, the Court considers
whether: 1)

the expert witness is qualiﬁed; 2) the evidence is admissible, relevant and reliable; 3) bases for
expert

opinion are those reasonably relied upon by experts in the ﬁeld; 4) the specialized knowledge will
assist the

judge: and 5) evidence will create unfair prejudice, confuse the issue or mislead the jury. J arwan,
