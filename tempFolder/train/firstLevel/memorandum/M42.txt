SUBJECT: Assessment of School-Based Management Level of Schools

1.

4.

The Revised School-Based Management (SBM) Assessment Tool is guided by the four principles of
ACCESS (A Child-and—Community Centered Education System). The indicators of SBM practices
are contextualized on the ideals of ACCESS school system. The unit of analysis is the school
system which are classiﬁed as developing, maturing and advanced (accredited level). The SBM
practice is ascertained by the existence of structured mechanisms, processes and practices in all in-
dicators. A team of practitioners and experts from the district, division, region and central office
validates the self-study/assessment before a level of SBM is established. A school on the advanced
level may apply for accreditation. The highest level, the “advanced” is a candidacy for accredita-
tion.

In this connection all schools will assess their SBM level using the attached tool and submit results
of assessment of the 40% (extent of SBM practice using the tool) and the 60% (access, eﬂiciency
and quality indicators) to the SGOD ofﬁce for consolidation on April 1, 2016.

Schools with the highest SBM level will be validated and assessed by the Division D-O-D (Docu-
ment Analysis-Observation—Discussion) Team.

Immediate attention is hereby directed.
