Town of Lauderdale-by—the—Sea OFFICE OF THE TOWN MANAGER
Memorandum Date: October 13, 2009 MOM Commissioner Stuart Dodd From: Esther
Colon, Town Manager Ca9.

Subject: EMAIL RESPONSE-1001/2009

Although an ITB (invitation to bid) or RFP (request for proposal) may be interpreted dif-
ferently and their processes may differ in the procurement environment among cities, 1
am providing you the distinction of both processes as staff and interpret it

An ITB is an invitation to contractors or equipment suppliers, through a bidding process,
to submit a proposal on a specific project to be realized or product of service to be fur-
nished. An ITB is usually used when discussions with the bidders are not required be-
cause the speciﬁcations of a product or service is known and the price may be the main
factor in selecting the successful bidder as long as the levels of service or quality of com-
modity is the same (i.e., Senior Center - ITB).

A RFP (request for proposal) typically involves more than a request for price and con-
tains detailed speciﬁcations for the services or construction project for which a proposal
is requested. After proposal is received by set date and time, discussion may be held on
proposals to clarify technical capabilities, discuss options provided by the proposers or
to note errors in submitted proposal (i.e., Seagrape project-RF P)

Thank you
