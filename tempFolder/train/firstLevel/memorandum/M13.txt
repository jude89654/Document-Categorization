OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: All Employees From: Greatest Boss Ever Date: March 14, 2011

Subject: NCAA Tournament week

Even though it is the opening week of the NCAA Tournament - with all of the games and ofÔ¨Åce pool
excitement that comes

with it - we all must remember that Our No. 1 job remains Serving Our Customers and clients

We must also not try to fool ourselves and pretend that we will be able to give our customers and cli-
ents our full attention in this most awesome of Weeks. To do SO WOuld be unfair to them.

So, until next Week when We can sincerely pay attention to Our customers and clients again, I want
you to AVOID ALL WORK AND FOCUS ON YOUR BRACKET
