MEMORANDUM TO. Wilfredo T. Laboy, Superintendent of Schools FROM George A. Collins,
Director of Finance, Capital, and Special Project. A (2 C,

SUBJECT: Masonry Services for New Lawrence High School

DATE: November 04 2004

Please beinforrned that Flansburgh Associates, Inc. did not accept brick for the New Lawrence High
School (NLHS) which was better performing and would have saved the owner at least $40K

This brick had a better water absorption rate, by 3% and a better compressive strength. by 13%.
than the brick which is currently being installed at NLHS. The architect listed the reasons of color
and design intent in rejecting the better performing brick. This decision by the architect was made
without consulting the owner. According to the mason subcontractor, who is installing brick at the
NLHS, the difference in color was minimal.

Please note that the brick currently being installed does not meet the speciﬁcations of the architect.
I have attached test results of the brick currently being installed at the high school from Endicott
Clay Products Co. and the better performingbrick submitted from Redland Brick Company which
was rejected by the architect

In correspondence from Vermont Brick, a distributor of Redland Brick, it is evident that the compa-
ny was willing to work with the architect on matching colors for the project,

ﬁnd this action by the architect most disturbing when a company offers a product of better quality
and a cost savings to the owner which is rejected by the architect.
