Subject: 2009 Budget First Quarter Report
Attached please ﬁnd the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 Budget First Quarter Report. This document
was prepared as promised in various discussions that preceded your adoption of the
2009/2010 "status quo" Budget. The City Administration made a commitment when the
budget was adopted that we would:
1) Not overreact to changing economic data,
2) Fight through the short term budget challenges by making timely and informed decisions, and
3) Responsibly address the long term structural, ﬁscal challenges facing the City.
This First Quarter Report lays the foundation by which we will keep that commitment.
The Management Services staff under the leadership of Tom Skrobola prepared this data rich,
38-page document in an effort to identify and quantify a broad spectrum of dynamic factors affect-
ing the current economic circumstance, establish a baseline and subsequently begin to track key pa-
rameters affecting the City's evolving ﬁscal condition.
The report's data includes Consumer Indicators, Economic indicators, Budget Highlights, Pension
Funding, City Revenues and Expenditures and Management Controls. As we track the data over
time, we will be able to draw ﬁrmer conclusions about probable trends and offer projections for City
revenues and expenditures to assure that we maintain balanced budgets and address long term, ﬁscal
system problems consistent with the goals of the 5-Year Fiscal Plan.
The following comments trace the evolution of the City's recent ﬁscal circumstances and
our understanding of same. In addition, they address the common concern of "what does it all
mean?"
