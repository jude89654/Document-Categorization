INTRODUCTION:

This Memorandum of Understanding GVIOU) addresses situations, which are complex and require
extensive communication and collaboration between Child Youth and Family Service (CYFS) and

PRINCIPLES:

1.

The welfare and interests of the unborn baby, infant, child or young person are paramount.

lf information is available that could help to keep an unborn baby, infant, child or young person safe
and well, this information should be shared between all parties.

Information will be shared in a timely manner. Processes for sharing information should be kept as
simple as possible and should build on existing systems.

In cases where CYFS is a legal guardian/custodian, the CYFS key social worker is responsible for
ensuring that the management plan is adhered to.

Commitment to inter-agency communication will be strengthened by establishing clear communica-
tion pathways.

There will be comprehensive documentation on planning, actions and outcomes by all parties in-
volved. Caregivers of children recovering from acute illness or with chronic illness have the right to
be fully informed about that child's condition and treatment.

Discharge planning is essential to ensure continuity of care. When risk to the unborn child is identi-
Ô¨Åed discharge planning begins prior to the baby being born. On admission to SCBU or children's
ward discharge planning should start immediately.
