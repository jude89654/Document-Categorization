From: Roy Chavez, Recreation Superintendent-Parks
Subject: Coastal Live Oak Trees on San Gabriel Ave. (Target Project) Date: July 14, 2008
The existing oak trees located on the 800 block N. San Gabriel Ave. cannot remain in their original
location. This is due to the two-story Target building being constructed right to the property line, and
the footing of the building will encroach into the public right of way approximately 36 inches +/—.
The digging of the footing and heavy equipment trafﬁc to construct this building will disturb the
sensitive root system of these oak trees greatly reducing their survival rate. The characteristics of
these trees are large spreading 50 to 70
wide and will not be able to reach that size growing next to the new building.
We are recommending that Target remove and replace the trees next to the building with sweet
shade trees which are a narrowly columnar tree and will match what is existing on the east side of
the building (Azusa Ave). Also we are recommending that Target install new larger planters further
away from the building and plant (4) 60 and (3) 48 box oaks
spaced evenly between the sweet shade trees.
Option 2 would be to box and move the existing oaks into the new planters with the high risk of
their non-survival in which case the city would end up having to replant at our
expense.
