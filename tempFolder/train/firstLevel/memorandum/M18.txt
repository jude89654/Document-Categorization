CACFP Policy Memorandum 2009-01

TO: CACFP Sponsors
FROM: Denise Hagan, Program Manager Community Nutrition Branch
RE: Questions and Answers Regarding the New Meal Pattern Requirements
DATE: October 1, 2008
We expected and received a lot of questions this year regarding the changes in the meal pattern re-
quirements. After conducting all the trainings, we have decided to give all sponsors one year to im-
plement the changes. This will give you time to revise your menus, and it will allow time for all par-
ticipants to get used to the new changes in the meal patterns. While conducting reviews this year, we
will not disallow meals that do not meet the new meal pattern requirements. We will be providing
technical assistance. However, starting in FY 2010, we expect all sponsors to have made the changes
to the meal pattern requirements.
As a reminder, if you cater your meals, you should have attached the ﬁrst three pages of the handout,
Additional Food Component Requirements. If you cater with a school district, you will need to work
with them, as schools have not implemented these changes yet.
The memo is in a question and answer format, so it should be easy to follow.
Please keep this memo on ﬁle with all other documentation and correspondence you receive from
us. Remember that this memo covers all sponsors, not just child care sponsors, so some questions
may not apply to your situation.
Licensing/CACFP
G. New State Regs (Licensing) say you must document on menus that are posted any changes that
may have been made on that day. Do we have to document this?
A. You have always had to note any substitutions on not only the posted menu, but also the Menu
and Production Records.
