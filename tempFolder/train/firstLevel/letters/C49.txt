To,

Dear Mr. MacBenett

I will like to bring to your attention the bad behavior of the authorities at the exam center AGB Testing
Center on June 20, 2013.

Some examinees complained about the poor facilities and alleged cheating frauds going on in the center. Au-
thorities got angered and irritated when they were complained about this. But instead of looking into matter
they started ï¬‚ipping the candidates who have come to give the exams. The manhandled many candidates and
started frisking them. They also abused many of them. Even when threatened of the police action they hardly
seem to be affected by that

We wish that you look into the matters as soon as possible and punish those responsible for that.

We hope that you will take the matter seriously and those suffered will be brought to justice.

Thank you.

Vincent Chan
