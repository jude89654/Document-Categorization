Dear Willie,

It is with sincere regret that I received your letter of resignation as Minister for Defence which I will now
submit to the President in accordance with the Constitution.

On the basis of our conversation, I very much appreciate that your decision reﬂects your own desire to
ensure that the important work of Government is not diverted by the current controversy.

I want to thank you for your hard work and commitment in carrying out your duties as Minister. I believe
that you have made a signiﬁcant contribution to the Governments in which you have served and have shown
great skill in overseeing the modernisation of the Defence Forces.

I look forward to continuing to work with you in Dail Eireann. Yours sincerely,

, my; 95h QA A)
