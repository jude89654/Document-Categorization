Mr. Emery Harrison Manager Human Resources Nashoba Valley Marketing Services

66 Cedar Street Lindsborg, KSSlO74

Dear Mr. Harrison

This is extremely difficult to say, but considering my personal circumstances, I am unable to continue my
work as a secretary at Nashoba Valley Marketing Services. As mentioned in my employment contract, I am
giving a two weeks notice of resignation. My last working day will be September 22.

The decision to leave was not easy as have worked here for a long time and considered my ofÔ¨Åce as a second
home. On the other hand, should move to Bogue by the end of this month to look after my ailing mother.
During this two weeks transition period, I will hand over my work to the employee whom you intend should
take up my position. If there are any notes that you would like me to prepare of an exit procedure that need
to be aware of, please let me know.

Thank you very much for your ongoing help and guidance. Sincerely,

Amelia Cornwall Secretary
