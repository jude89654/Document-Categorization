Mr. Edgar Norton General Manager Kramden Foods Company 15 Main Street Newark, NJ 05555

Dear Ed,

With sometrepidation, I am writing this resignation letter. My last day of employment with Kramden Foods
will be April 14 of next month, While my tenure here has been a wonderful learning experience, I have been
offered an exciting opportunity that is far too promising to turn down.

The last nine years have been a pleasure. I started here as a clerk and never imagined I would end up a
member of senior management I cannot deny that without what I have learned working with you and our
team of fantastic employees that I could even pretend this new opportunity would be offered to me It was
here at Kramden that I reﬁned my skills in accounting, ﬁnancial infrastructure and balance SV Stells

I am more than ready to help ﬁnd my replacement. I would like my last ofﬁcial duty here to be ensuring a
smooth transition, minimizing disruption to the company's operations as much as possible. I already have a
few names in mind that I will passalong to you and other key management members via a conﬁdential mem-
orandum upon request.

I write this letter with a heavy heart. I would not like this resignation letter to be the end of my relationship
with Kramden Foods. I would be honored to maintain contact with all of you. My personal email is rogers-
foodaliyahoocom and my cellis 555,555,5555

All the best,

Roger Seawell
