Ref: Defective Series

Dear Mr. Jefferson,

I wish to bring to your knowledge that the handsets delivered to us in the series KL3800 are all defective.
This series of Mobile handsets was purchased by our company on 2nd September bearing the transaction
code 2345789.

As per our contractual agreement, the handsets should have been checked for all defects before they were
dispatched to us. I regret to inform, that your Quality Control Department did not perform the necessary
trials and checks This is a serious breach of our agreement. I request you to look into the matter and send us
a replacement at the earliest. I look forward to your co-operation in the matter so that we can continue to
have mutually beneÔ¨Åcial business dealings in the future.

Thanking You,

Sincerely

Joyce Hank
