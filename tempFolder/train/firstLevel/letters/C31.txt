Ref. Unsatisfactory service Dear Mr. Warner.

I have been a regular customer of your restaurant since you opened three years ago. I have been coming back
and bringing friends and family to the place because of great—tasting food. Last November 30, brought my
family to your restaurant once again for a joyous celebration. Sadly, we had to leave your restaurant without
tasting the food. Thirty minutes passed before a waiter took our orders. We were told that the food would be
served promptly. An hour passed and when another waiter ﬁnally assisted us, the food was still unserved.
Frustrated, we left the restaurant and went home, no longer in a celebratory mood.

I hope your restaurant improves its service soon. The high number of Customers should not be a cause for
delay lest customers like us be put off despite the good food.

Best Wishes,

Michael Snowden
