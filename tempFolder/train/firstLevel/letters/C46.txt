ref: Complaint regarding allowances.

Dear Mr, Anderson,

I am Writing this complaint because it has been two years since we occupied your house and we are paying
our rent regularly, Before renting out the house you had aqreed to carry out the necessary repairs in the house
and also aqreed that the half yearly maintenance will also be carried by you. As per the agreement the

rent we are paying includes the allowance for the maintenance and repairs.

Instead of this since you have rented the house I am carrying out the maintenance and repair at my own cost
have already informed you about this and now request you to reduce the rent. I am enclosing the bill of
repair and maintenance with this letter and hoping that my request will be entertained soon.

Thank You,

Sincerely,

Pearson Brown
