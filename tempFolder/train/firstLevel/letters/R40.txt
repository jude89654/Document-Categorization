This is to ofﬁcially inform you that I am resigning from the post of Finance Manager from ABB Associates

was a difﬁcult decision for me after a fruitful career at ABB Associates for the past seven years, I think it
now time to move on. I have accepted a position as a senior manager in a renowned financial firm and am
sure that will help me further in my career growth.

experience to work here in the competent atmosphere and facing challenges along with my wonderful team-
mates.

I promise you all my support for a smooth transition of my job and responsibilities.

Appreciate your time in considering this matter.

Sincerely
