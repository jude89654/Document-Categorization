Dear Sir/Madam:

With reference to the ad which appeared in the Post Newspaper of October 2, I am applying for a Scholar-
ship at the Copperbelt University. I am interested in pursuing Computer Studies being offered at the insti-
tution, as well as studying and Staying in Zambia.

Last year, I studied A-Levels at the University of Zimbabwe and obtained very good results. I was waiting
for admittance into my second year of my studies when I came across the advertisement and presumed that
it would be more advantageous for me to continue my studies in Zambia because of the high quality of ed-
ucation administered in Zambian Universities. Please find enclosed my statement of results.

Here is a little information about myself. I am a hardworking individual who pays very serious attention to
her studies. In addition, I also work very well with others. In fact, what helped me to pull through school
and get such good grades was my willingness to work along with others.

There are a few things though that I would like to ﬁnd out. To what extent do you provide ﬁnancial assis-
tance to students? You did not mention anything about travel

costs. Do I have to find my own transportation? Also, I want to ﬁnd out how the academic calendar is ar-
ranged at the university. I will really appreciate this information.

yours Faithﬁilly,

Aggie Zulu
