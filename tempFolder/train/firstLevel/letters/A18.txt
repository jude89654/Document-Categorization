Dear Mr. McDonald:

I am replying to an ad for warehouse help that appeared in the New York Post on March 11, 2006.

Since graduating from High School in 2003, I have gained valuable experience in Warehouse work. In one
of my jobs, I worked as a Warehouse clerk for a large import/export company. In another, I worked at a
lumber warehouse in yard work. In addition, the plumbing business is one with which I am already some-
what familiar. My uncle is an experienced plumber, and when I was in high school, I did some work with
him informally as an assistant in order to earn some extra cash. I believe my experience would make me a
valuable employee.

I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and to talk with you further about my quali-
ﬁcations. I do not have a telephone, but you can leave a message for me at (718) 330-0911, or at the above
address. A copy of my resume is attached.

Sincerely,

mwﬂm

Nelson Jimenz
