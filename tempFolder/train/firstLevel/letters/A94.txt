Dear Ms. Romanovski,

Your ad seeking a results-focused Assistant Store Manager caught my eye, as I am a talented retail profes-
sional looking to join the team at a growing establishment.

My outgoing personality and strong multi-tasking ability are an asset to any retail environment, as are my
communication and leadership skills. Our outlet has seen a noticeable improvement in proﬁts as a result of
my results-oriented customer engagement. A talented salesperson adept in up selling, I am also a team
player who thrives in a collaborative environment.

Over the course of my lO+—year career, I have:

- Generated repeat and increased business through service-focused leadership.

- Lead weekly meetings to inform, train, and motivate store employees.

- Completed administrative duties such as payroll and reporting. Merchandised items effectively to in-
crease sales.

I hope that you will consider my body of experience in your search for a new Assistant Store Manager. My
attached resume lists my additional qualiﬁcations.

Please feel free to contact me at your convenience to discuss your needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Valeria Gardner
