Dear Mr. Wilson:

To me, politics is fast-paced, edgy, and cutthroat (in a good way). That's why I'm passionate about politics
and that's why I'm dying to get involved.

As you'll see from my resume, I have a wealth of experience in the ﬁeld. I've worked for the House Major-
ity Whip in Kentucky, I‘ve been a campaign staffer, and I've held leadership positions in Student Govem-
ment at the University of Kansas.

I'll be in Washington next fall as a Political Management Masters student at George Washington and hope
to join you at the Democratic Congressional Committee this summer.

I know the page job is not the most glamorous position on Capitol Hill-but to me it's not about glamour.
It‘s about working hard, making a contribution and getting involved. I'm energetic and eager to enter the
ﬁeld and willing to do whatever it takes to ultimately become successful.

I look forward to following up with you about the job and will plan to contact you in a week.

Regards,

Flora Scheller
