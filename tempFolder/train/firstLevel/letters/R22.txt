Dear Chief of Medical Staff Allen Lacy,

Please allow this letter to serve as my two-week resignation notice from Alpine Hospital. I am resigning my
position as an emergency physician to start my own personal practice in my hometown. This has been a
cream of mine since medical school and now Ô¨Ånally get to bring that cream to reality,

I want to thank you sincerely for all of the time and effort you put into making me into the physician that I
am today. I also want to point out that was very proud to work so closely with a dedicated team of medical
professionals. The staff and myself were on hand for two major natural disasters and feel that our perfor-
mance was not only admirable but it saved a lot of lives that cay.

I do understand that this leaves the hospital in a tough spot when it comes to an emergency physician but my
window for being able to open my practice is narrow and want to take the opportunity while it exists. If after
have left the hospital you need to get a hold of me for any reason please feel free to came at 555-433-5454 or
email me attonySpartogemailcom. Your calls and emails will always be welcome to me.

Sincerely Yours

Dr. Anthony W. Sparto
