Dear Sir,

This complaint is to bring to your attention the problems caused by the location of your ofﬁce building and
your staff to its immediate neighbour. The building is situated in a residential area and hence must comply by
certain moral and social responsibilities.

Most of the garbage ﬁom your ofﬁce is being thrown directly in the roads. This causes the pedestrians prob-
lem in walking and also leads to the blockage of pipes along the road. There is no arrangement for parking
around your ofﬁce and most of the cars belonging to your staff are parked on the road causing trafﬁc jams,
The noise level generated from your building is also very high esp. that of generator. This is causing prob-
lems to neighbours.

This has been informed to your ofﬁce earlier also, but no steps were taken. We request you to consider the
matter immediately and steps be taken in this regard, failing which we might be forced to pursue legal course
of action.

Yours truly,

President J eric Bond
