Dear Sir,

I am a resident of Boston city, On 25th April, 2010 bought a laptop with serial no. 36729 from Messer Bright
and Jonson electronics for $700. The company gave a 1 year Warranty and 6 months money back guaranty. I
was told that in case of any trouble with the piece all my money will be given back to me with immediate
effect Or if I Wish I can choose another model.

After all these clauses have purchased the laptop but since the very ﬁrst day it was troublesome for me. The
processor was very slow and it was taking a lot of time even in a smallest action of copy pasting. Not only
this but the hard disk also crashed and all my important data were lost.

I complaint for it and even my repeated requests for a replacement have fallen on deaf ears. I had written half
a dozen letters to the Manager of the ﬁrm, All that I got was areassurance from them that they are looking
into the matter.

have been running from pillar to post for last 8 days.

And now I am tired of it, therefore request you to kindly accept my complaint letter and ﬁle a case against
the above mentioned ﬁrm. I am enclosing all the necessary documents like the cash memo, the guarantee
Card and the various letters that had written to the ﬁrm's Manager, along with their replies,
