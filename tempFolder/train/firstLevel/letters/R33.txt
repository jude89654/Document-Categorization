To: Ms. Kristine Joanne Olmedo Supply Chain Manager Universal Robina Corporation

Cc Ging C. Casiano Human Resources Manager Universal Robina Corporation

Dear Ms. Joanne.

I would like to inform you my irrevocable resignation from my position as Warehouse Assistant of Universal
Robina Corporation Binan branch, effective May 07.2012.

It is a great opportunity working at Universal Robina Corporation (URC) considering the fact that I have no
enough knowledge regarding my position and still giving me the chance to work at Universal Robina Corpo-
ration. I enjoyed with your company with great people around me but things wouldnâ€˜t work out the way I
wanted to be. That is why I'm leaving my position and take new challenges and phase of my career.

Thank you for the opportunity as well as the knowledge that you provided me during the last ten months.
Sincerely,

Abregail Y. Argosino
