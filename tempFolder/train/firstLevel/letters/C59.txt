Horton's Steak and Seafood Restaurant Hometown. A

Dear Mr. Horton

Up until recently we have enjoyed coming to Horton's Over the years for the food and the service. Unfortu-
nately, after our visit this past Friday, this view has changed for us.

This past Friday our immediate family brought other family members to the restaurant who was visiting
from another state. Instead of the usual delightful service and fare we encountered problems almost at every
turn, The issue started when our reservation for eight was pushed back because of overﬁlled capacity and we
were forced to wait for more than 30 minutes. We were ﬁnally given around table which was crowded for a
group of eight.

While sat reading over the dinner selections, lower heard people at a table behind me discussing what they
were Ordering. Many of the items did not appear on my menu. 1 can only assume they had the regular dinner
menu. The Waiter was busy clearing other tables and taking dessert orders while waited to place mine. He
then moved to a table of eight behind me and began taking their orders. Many hadn‘t decided yet and the pro-
cess was dragging on and on. Since had already been sitting there about 15 minutes without so much as a
glass of water, left.

This table was near the middle of the dining area and was surrounded by other large groups who were quite
noisy. As an overall rating, our experience at your establishment was not near what we had come to expect
from Horton's. Hopefully you will be able to return to your previous level of excellence.

Sincerely

Harvey Harman
