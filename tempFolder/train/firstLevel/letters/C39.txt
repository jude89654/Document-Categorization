Dear Mr. Stevenson.

1, Mr. Scott from the BMC Constructions Ltd, am forced to write this letter to bring your attention to the fact
that the quality of the construction materials which you Ô¨Årm, MMRDA Constructions Materials Ltd, have
been delivering to the Galaxy Towers project of BMC Constructions Ltd is getting deteriorated by every
passing consignment. The one before the last consignment did have some glitches in terms of quality. How-
ever, considering the fact that the materials were at par with the requirement levels, it was neglected.
However, the last consignment not only had a quality blemish to unbearable extent but even the time of de-
livery has breached the stipulated time. I, hereby, put forward my grievance in this regard and urge you to
look into this matter at the earliest. I am hopeful that necessary actions will be taken, including the replace-
ment of the construction materials delivered in the name of last consignment,

Yours sincerely,

Mr. Scott
