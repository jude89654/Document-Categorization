Complaint letter against loss of belongings

Hello Sir Madam,

This is to bring to your notice that last nightlleft some of my belongings including laptop and some jewelry
in room number 615 of your hotel. It was claimed to leave valuable things unworriedly in rooms if going
Out. It was hardly ﬁfteen minutes went out and found everything Vanished after Coming back. had an imme-
diate talk with your in house hotel staff regarding the matter. But none of them found to be showing any in-
terest on the loss. Instead was rebuked to leave things at my room unattended; where it was clearly men-
tioned in your check in kit that it is absolutely safe to leave things back.

It is a grave concern from a boarder‘s point of view about such illicit things happening in presence of all the
hotel staffs. Hope to get some positive response from you soon

Thanks.

Prof. Rehana J alal
