Dear Ms. Smith,

A friend just told me that you are recruiting for the position of Housekeeping Manager with Blue Diamond
Hotels. I would like to take this opportunity to come and interview for this position, and I have included
all my required qualifications.

Since last eight years I have been working as a Chamber Manager for Le Royale Hotels and restaurants. I
have a thorough experience in maintaining health standards, cleaning rooms and providing excellent ser-
vice to every customer that checks-in in our hotel.

Earlier to this, I used to work as a seasonal supervisor for a local motel in the housekeeping department,
where was the team lead for four chambennaids working under me, and we were responsible for thorough-
ly cleaning the rooms. I am very well of all the things that are required to give quality health service and re-
markable customer service, and I wish to bring the same to Sunn Sand Hotels and Restaurants.

Thank you for going through my resume and cover letter and I await the possibility of meeting you in
person.

Sincerely,

John Johnson
