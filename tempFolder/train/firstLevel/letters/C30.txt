lam writing this letter to lodge an official complaint about the unsatisfactory customer service that received
in your store located at Park Street on 15 July.

have been visiting your store for alongtime period now but the last time visited your store, was completely
disappointed with the kind of service offered. When walked into the store, kept wandering for almost 5 min-
utes before any of the staff stepped into ask my requirements. I was completely treated as invisible for those
5 minutes which felt insulting. After was asked about my requirements, the staff members were very casual
and kept reﬁising about the other varieties available in the stock

When could not ﬁnd anythingsuitable and tried to walk out of the store, even overhearda disgraceful com-
ment from one of the staff members which was beyond my tolerance tried to lodge a complaintimmediately
but was infomed that had to go through a formal complaint procedure which is whyam writing a letter to
you.

Kindly gothrough my complaint and take appropriate measures to teach and train your staff about ethics and
basic manners.

Thanks forgoing through my complaint Sincerely,

Sarah Parker.
