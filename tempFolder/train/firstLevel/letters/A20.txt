Subject: Summer job application.

Dear Anne,

I am interested in the summer position at Sarasota Store advertised in The Statesman.

I have excellent Communication skills and an aptitude for Customer Service. My past experience as a vol-
unteer at Sarasota Hospital made it necessary for me to focus on providing quality customer service, and
also enabled me to work with all types of people.

I believe that my communication skills, customer service abilities, and positive work ethic would make me
an asset to your store.

Thank you for your consideration. I can be reached at peterpanG)gmail.com or 111-] 11 1-3333. I look for-
ward to hearing from you Soon.

Yours Faithfully,

Patrick V. Witt.
