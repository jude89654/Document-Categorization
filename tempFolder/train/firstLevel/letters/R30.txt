Honorable Alberto R. Gonzales Attorney General US. Department of Justice Washington, DC. 20530

Dear Attorney General Gonzales:

This is to advise you of my intention to step down from my position as Deputy Attorney General on a date to
be determined in the late summer. The ﬁnancial realities of college-age children and two decades of public
service lead me to a long overdue transition in my career.

I greatly appreciate the opportunity and privilege I have enjoyed for the past seven years to serve my country
at the Department of Justice as both a United States Attorney and the Deputy Attomey General. The history
of the Department will record the extraordinary challenge we faced after September 11, 2001, and in particu-
lar, how those of us who served as United States Attorneys embraced our new mission of preventing another
terrorist attack.

I am grateful for your friendship and support, and the tireless efforts of the men and women in the Ofﬁce of
the Deputy Attorney General. I look forward to working with you to ensure a smooth transition in my ofﬁce.
Sincerely,

%

aul J. McNulty Deputy Attomey General
