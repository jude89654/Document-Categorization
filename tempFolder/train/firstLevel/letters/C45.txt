Dear Mr. Khan.

1 am writing to issue a complaint regarding a recent product purchase. On 12 April, 2010 purchased a Juicer
Mixer Grinder with a serial no. 194582 and product model no. is D3906 from one of your outlets for the
amount of $130. The product is not working properly. The grinder blades are blunt and while running the
mixer the machine becomes very hot in few seconds. One of the juicer attachments was broken. I complaint
three time at your customer service center but no action has been taken till date.

I called at your customer service center for three times but so far did not get any solution of my problem.
Though shop many times from your outlets but never

faced this kind of trouble ever.

I request you to kindly look into the matter and resolve my problem as early as possible. Enclosed is the
copy ofthe bill and my complaint no. is 25632.

Thank You,

Sincerely,

Fatima Adam
