Dear Mr. Ronney

This is the report you requested for analyzing and recommend a network management system. This report
contains the information about the MIB data types, 081 network management models, three different ver-
sions of SNMP, and two types of correlation techniques.

In the ﬁrst section, twelve MIB data types have been discussed. Besides, descriptions of four 081 network
management models are included in this report. In order to help you to gain a better picture to the OSI net-
work management models, several diagrams are included in this section.

Moreover, I have included the Pros and Cons of different SNMP versions and issues of integrating equip-
ment from different manufacturers. In the last section of the report.

Case-Based reasoning and Codebook Correlation Model will be discussed.

It has been pleasure and challenge working on this report. Please feel free to contact me in case of clariﬁca-
tion or queries on this report.

Yours sincerely,

Chong Kai Loon
