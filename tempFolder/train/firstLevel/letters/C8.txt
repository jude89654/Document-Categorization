Dear Sir/madam,

I have enclosed a copy of the letter which I sent to you regarding the above parking charge.

I did not hear anything from you till two days ago. With no mention of my contesting the above parking
charge as I was not parked on a yellow line as there is no yellow line where I parked.

And I have photographic evidence showing there is no yellow line where I was parked as I stated before was
there are also no signs to signify any restrictions

I would be most grateful if you would give the evidence provided consideration as I would wish you to
please review the evidence and uphold my contest against this parking ticket Ô¨Åne.

Thank you for your time

Kind Regards,

Matthew Chris
