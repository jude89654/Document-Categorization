MRS. LAURIC E GUILLEN—FELEO Competition Chairperson 2012 C inemalaya Foundation

Dear Mrs. Guillen-Feleo

It is with great regret that I tender my resignation as member of the Selection Committee of the New Breed
and the Director's Showcase Categories of Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival 2012. Through
the gruelling process of selecting the ﬁnalists for the prestigious ﬁlm festival, I have Come to the conclusion
that there are indeed great ﬁlmrnaking talents that are yet to be discovered and tapped in the country.
Unfortunately, the recent events involving the disqualiﬁcation of a ﬁlmmaker and his ﬁlm because of crea—
tive differences have caused me to re-evaluate my participation in the Film Festival. Clearly, the current ﬁlm
festival and I are working on two different principles as to what independent ﬁlmmaking is and should be. I
simply can no longer be part of a system which no longer believe in,

respect the contributions of Cinemalaya to the ﬁlmmakers who have now established themselves as formida-
ble and important members of the filmmaking community which I owe my passion to. It is because of this
respect that l have decided to now withdraw my name as member of the Selection Committee despite having
participated in it by investing my time and effort in reading through all the submitted treatments and Screen-
plays.

Thank you
