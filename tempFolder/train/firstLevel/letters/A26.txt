17 October 2010. Subject: Scholarship application letter. Dear Gregory,

1 am doing MCA ﬁnal year in your college. In the ﬁrst semester exam I have got very good marks. And
even in the year 2008-2009 I have also got scholarship based on my high academic grades.

My father was a government teacher and now he is retired. He is getting a pension of Rs 900/— per month.
This amount of money is not enough for education fees. So because of my bad ﬁnancial Condition, please
I request you to give me scholarship for the ﬁnal year.

Thank you for your consideration of my application. Thanking you.

Yours Truly,

Patricia J. Culbreth.
