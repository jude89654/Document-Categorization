Janet Preirlito, City Clerk
City of Buyntun Beach. FL
Dear Janet,
The purpose of this letter is to inform you that effective immediame I am resigning from
my position as a commissioner for the City of Boynton Beach. The time has come for
me to move on. My new opportunities and my mother's medical needs are my priorities.
Now that my bean and i are expecting a Musing in the new year this leaves me without
enough time for anything else it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as a
commissioner for 5 yearsr Thank you.
