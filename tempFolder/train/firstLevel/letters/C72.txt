Re: Barking Dog Complaints

Since August of 2010, our Dog Control Officers have invested numerous hours investigating a number of
complaints from you about barking dogs at several residences in your neighbourhood in the subdivision. We
have concluded that your allegations do not contain the substance required to proceed with any enforcement
action. Due to the limited resources we have in the Dog Control service, we will no longer investigate these
complaints.

In order to proceed with ticketing and any associated legal proceedings, the Regional District of Central
Okanagan bears the burden of proof. The evidence you have submitted against dog owners in your commu-
nity is not sufﬁcient to proceed, and is subject to reasonable doubt which has been argued by the alleged dog
owners and neighbouring residents of the dog owners. As stated before, we do not have the resources to con-
tinue investigating these allegations and ﬁarther investigation is not in the best interest of your community in
the

Except where you wish to report a new concern about a property not yet reported, our Dog Control will no
longer investigate these barking dog complaints.

Yours truly
