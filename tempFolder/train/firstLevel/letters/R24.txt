To whom it may concern,

Over the past twelve months have loyally served this corporation as a Store Associate, Through times good
and bad, have stood by the side of my company and have not faltered. have helped countless customers,
worked innumerable hours, and befriended more than a few of you during this time. Thus, it is with heavy
heart that must inform you of my impending resignation. In my pursuit of an ever-improving life to come,
fear 1 must depart from you, dear reader, in order to follow my own path. Two weeks from now, my time
here will draw to a close and my eyes will set upon a new horizon - a brighter ﬁiture for myself and for this
world. pray you, do not be saddened by my looming departure, for we all have a destiny to meet, and the
time has come for me to leave you. Though we may never meet on this earth again, friends and colleagues,
know 1 will always be with you in spirit, and 1 will never forget the people 1 have met and the challenges
have encountered along the way. And may we, in some distant future time, be reunited in that Great Ofﬁce
Supply Store in the Sky, and sell office supplies

happily there, for all eternity to come.

Your ever-humble servant,
