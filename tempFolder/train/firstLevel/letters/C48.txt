Dear Sir.

I have an account in your bank from past four months and the account number is 37929731. had applied for
the debit card at the time of opening the account but till now have not received the debit card nor the pin
number. It's very difficult for me to come to bank every now and then to withdraw money stay alone with
my six year old son and my husband keeps travelling for business have to take care of all the household
work and other responsibilities.

1 was informed by the staff that will be getting the debit card kit within 15 days but didn't receive anything.
Finally gave a call to your customer care department and there again faced problems giving all the details
and ﬁnally the person informed me that it will take another twenty-ﬁve days. So I waited again but didn't re-
ceive anything. I ﬁnally decided to meet the supervisor and he told me to fill in a fresh form as there had
been a confusion had been a customer of same bank from past 10 years in another city and opened an new
account here as the transfer procedure were very long, but now feel should have done the same. It is really
disappointing that the banks take so long to give a debit card.

I request you to look into the matter and have debit card issued soon.

Thanks and regards

Benedict Prats
