Dear Mr. Steven,

I would like to make complaint against your project in the city that you have planned. I would like to make
you aware that the place where you have planned your project to be completed is a green zone. you do the
project on such place then it will affect the environment and will cause some problems to the residents
around this place.

I would like to suggest you to change the location of your upcoming project. There are several places availa-
ble which you can choose for your project.

I hope you will give due consideration to my complaint and will change your decision and will affect the en-
vironment. If the machinery is not displaced from that place within Ô¨Åfteen days then your project will liable
to face a suit in the court.

Thanking You,

Sincerely,

Richard White
