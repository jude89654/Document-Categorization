Dear Sir,

I wish to lodge a formal complaint against the services that was rendered by your staff to me on 28 July
2014. On the aforementioned date had gone with my family to your restaurant and had asked for a Pasta
Mexicana penne amongst other dishes and drinks

We were served the food and after eating a portion of it, my wife found a small insect in the pasta We imme-
diately brought this to the notice of the steward on duty who we could see went and spoke to the manager.
Inspite of all this, and repeated requests, we waited for another 40 minutes and still no one came to our table
either to remove the dishes or to speak to us about the happening in the end the manager came and said that
the pasta was on the house and handed us a bill for the rest of the amount. I was not expecting an on the
house offer, but a replacement of the dish.

Your restaurant is one of the premier destinations in the city when it comes Italian food, and the incident on
Saturday has shown poorly on your staff. Please look into this matter immediately and I hope you will take
necessary actions for the same.

Thanking you.

Yours Faithfully,

Patricia Rose
