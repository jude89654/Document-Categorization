Dear Human Resource Manager:

1 am applying for the position of Sales Executive, which was advertised on Aug. 4 with the career services
center at xxx University. The position seems to ﬁt very well with my education, experience, and career in-
terests.

According to the advertisement, your position requires excellent communication skills, computer literacy,

tion, speech Communications, and business Writing. I understand the position also requires a candidate
who is team- and detail-oriented, works well under pressure, and is able to deal with people in departments
throughout the ﬁrm. These are skills I developed both in my course work and in my recent internship at
United Distribution Inc. in Ho Chi Minh City.

My background and goals seem to match your requirements well. I am conﬁdent that 1 can perform the job
effectively, and I am excited about the idea of working for a dynamic, nationally recognized human re-
source ﬁrm. If you would like to schedule an interview or otherwise discuss my interest in this position,
please call me at 09549873456. 1 will be available at your Convenience.
