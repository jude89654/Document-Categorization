Dear Mr. Harrison:

This letter is a formal resignation from my position as a Cashieron2 weeks' notice.

The past two years that have spent working as a Cashier at tesco Bell have been the most amazing years of
my life as have learned from my experience extensively.

However, it is time for me to move on as have been offered a sales position in

Northport and need to move from Reformat the end of three weeks.

Tesco Bellhastaught me all that know about the retail world and I am truly grateful for this experience and
the chance provided to polishmy skillsMy supervisors and coworkers have been truly amazing in helping
me learn the ropes and it is because

of these people that lama professional at what I do. It is unfortunate that will have

to move sofar in order to pursue a job near to my home.

During this two weeks transition, will not only train the person who is going to

replaceme, but also, will assist proactively in looking for the right candidate.

would appreciate it if you provide me with a reference letter at the end of two weeks

to make things smoother. Thank you for the tremendous support you have provided
