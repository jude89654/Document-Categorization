Complaint Letter For Apartment Management

10 October 2014

Dear Mr. Mark Smith,

This is to notify the XYZ Housing ltd of a formal complaint regarding my apartment 322 .N. Benson Blvd
35.

There is a major problem of water leakage in the bathroom The passage to the drainages blocked and water
is leaking continuously. The bathrooms ﬂooded whenever we use it and stinks because of this.

I tried to clear the clog in the drain by using a powder meant to clear the drainage but in vain. Now we are
not able to use the bathroom for the last three days and have complained to the secretary but there is no reply
from him so far

The lease contract clearly states that such things need to be resolved by the apartment management but 1 am
really disappointed by the neglect from the concerned people request you to look into the matter urgently.
If I don't receive a reply asper the response time in contract, I reﬁase payment of any ﬁarther rent until this
issues resolved.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Sincerely,

Henry Luke
