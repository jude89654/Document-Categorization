Ms. Jones,

In our rental agreement, it is not permitted to create an environment within your home that allows for exces-
sive and unnecessary noise. Please refer to the section on excessive noise that is found under item 6 in your
rental agreement.

This letter is being written to inform you of 9 complaints received from April 10 to April 14, 2014, in regards
to excessive noise levels Originating from your unit. As per the rental agreement, this letter serves as your
notiﬁcation of these complaints and that you are in violation of the noise policy of the agreement.

To remedy this situation, please make sure to keep the noise levels in your unit at a minimum whenever pos-
sible. Although you are allowed to host guests for a speciﬁc period of time, the noise your guests generate
are your responsibility. Further violations of the noise stipulations of the rental agreement may result in fur-
ther actions, which may lead up to and include eviction proceedings.

Thank you for your prompt action in addressing these concerns.

Sincerely,

Rebbeca Stilton
