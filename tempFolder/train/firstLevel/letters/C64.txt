Dear Sir,

We are sorry to say that recently we have received many complaints from our customers about your
ball-pens and reﬁlls. They have not been giving desired satisfactory service in spite of the fact they are rela-
tively expensive and our customers buy them as items of value.

These items about which have received complaints in person, in writing and also over phone, relate to the
batch supplied against our order no. 123 of 01 March. This order was placed on the basis a few sample
ball-pens and reﬁlls left with us by your representative. We have ourselves compared the samples with those
supplied later and have noted that the latter are not upto the mark,

There is something wrong with these ball—pens and reﬁlls, particularly with their tips and ink. They leak,
overﬂow and spoil the hands and apparels of the owners. Some of them blot off the sheet when writing. This
is really unfortunate and regrettable.

Therefore, we want you to immediately replace the consignment and take away the pens and reﬁlls still left
with us out of this lot. Please ensure that this replacement lot should be without any defective ballpen and
reﬁll. These must be expected quality and standard worth more for the value of the money spent by our cus-
tomers.

Yours faithfully,

Alex Cabero
