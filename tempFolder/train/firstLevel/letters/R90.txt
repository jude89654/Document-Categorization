Dear MS. Wilson

I am writing this correspondence to let you know that I will be resigning from my position as fundraising
choir for the London Elementary School PTAI have recently accepted a full time job outside the home and
no longer can devote the time needed to take on my chair responsibilities. My last day serving the PTA will
be October 3 2014. Please consider this my formal two weeks' committee resignation letter.

hope this does not cause the committee a great deal of inconvenience. I will be happy to dedicate sometime
over the next two weeks to assist in streamlining existing projects and in helping on interim choir to get ac-
quainted with the committee responsibilities. Please feel free to coll me at 1555) 555-5555 if you should
need to speak with me.

It has been a pleasure serving on the PTA and leading the fundraising committee. I have enjoyed working
with my fellow volunteers and helping to make our school a better place.I wish you all success in the future
and thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely

Charlene Holiday

PTA Fundraising Chair
