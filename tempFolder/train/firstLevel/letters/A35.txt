Dear Miss. Earnest, Subject: Job application for Armored Car Guard

I write to you to tell that I am interested in being the Armored Car Guard of Theft-Expert Banking Ser-
vicers. Kindly consider this letter of mine as a formal application for the position. I came across the adver-
tisement in the monthly employment magazine of the state. I have a commercial driver's license and an ex-
perience of three years, I am proud to say that I was never responsible for any lapse of delivery or thefts in
these three years of my work experience.

I am well acquainted with the kind of responsibilities an armored car guard is needed to take. I can also
render shift duties in night shifts. I am sure you will not be disappointed with me. I request for an opportu-
nity to serve your organization.

Sincere regards, (signature) Lin Reeves
