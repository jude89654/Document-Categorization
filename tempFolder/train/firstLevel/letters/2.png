Dear Human Resource Manager:
I am applying for the position of Sales Executive, which was advertised on
Aug. 4 with the career services center at ><><>< University. The position seems
to ﬁt very well with my education, experience, and career interests.
According to the advertisement, your position requires excellent
communication skills, computer literacy, and a 8.8. degree in business,
economics, or ﬁnance. Iwill be graduating from ><><>< University this month
with a 8.5. degree in finance. My studies have included courses in computer
science, business administration, speech communications, and business
writing. I understand the position also requires a candidate who is team— and
detail-oriented, works well under pressure, and is able to deal with people in
departments throughout the ﬁrm. These are skills I developed both in my
course work and in my recent internship at United Distribution Inc. in Ho Chi
Minh City.
My background and goals seem to match your requirements well. I am
conﬁdent that I can perform the job effectively, and I am excited about the
idea of working for a dynamic, nationally recognized human resource ﬁrm.
