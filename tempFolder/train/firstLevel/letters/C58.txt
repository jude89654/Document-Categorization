Complaint Letter for Bad Service

Dear Mr. Hamilton

I have been a loyal customer of your stores for the past 5 years, I have time and again received great service
at your mart which is one of the main reasons shop at your store. But to my surprise, on the date of 23rd
August, 2010. I was at the receiving end of some very poor service at your mart.

On the said date. I made the purchase of my weekly groceries, and headed towards the cash counter to pay
for them. The person sitting at the counter. who was wearing the name tag of Jen. was talking on her cell-
phone, When asked her to make the bill, she said she would do it in 5 minutes, and resumed her conversation
on the phone. After a good 10 minutes, she started with her work and did it very slowly. The bill, apparently
totalled up to more than expected, so asked her to recheck it. Instead, she talked to me very rudely, and told
me that if I did not like the prices, I could take my business elsewhere.

I was appalled at such behaviour, and have a good mind to take my business else where as suggested hope
you would look into the matter. and make sure such an incident is not repeated Your company has been
known to provide goodservices. and such events tarnish the company name, so please address this issue soon
Thank you for your co-operation.

Sincere Regards. Timothy Stark
