Dear Ms. Preston:

After reading about your company’s aggressive and successful publicity campaigns in the March
3 edition of the Examiner, I became very interested in seeking an entry—level position with your
firm. Dr. Vernon Cluff, a professor in a communications course I am currently enrolled in, gave
me your name as one of his former students, As you can see from the enclosed resume, I will
graduate from Utah State University in June with a bachelor of science degree in English.

As a publicity assistant, I can offer you strong organizational, interpersonal, and writing skills,
Last year, while working in the University’s alumni office, I was in charge of promoting the Fall
Alumni Reunion Bash, I devised and implemented an innovative mail campaign that targeted
more than 19,000 letters to seven different audiences. Attendance increased 36 percent over the
previous four years. These implementations, I believe, would beneﬁt your current research in
consumer trends,

I am very interested in working at Prospero. I will be in the San Diego area on April 15-18 and
would like to meet with you then to discuss my qualifications and possible employment
opportunities with Prospero. I will call the morning of March 15 to arrange for a possible time to
get together, Should you desire additional information or references before then, I can be
contacted at (435) 755—9887 or by e—mail at rayj@cc,usu.edui I look forward to speaking with
you soon.

Sincerely,

(Written Signature)

Ray Johnson
