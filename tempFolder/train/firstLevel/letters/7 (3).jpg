Dear Pat:

This is my formal notiﬁcation that I am resigning from New Covenant Church as a
Production Intern. Sunday, May 23rd will be my last day of employment.

I count it a privilege to have had this opportunity to work at New Covenant. l have
learned much from you and from those who have taken me underneath their wings
during my time here. Although this was a job, for me it was more ofa ministry and
an opportunity to serve Jesus. and I will be ever grateful for my time at New
Covenant

The Lord has opened up an opportunity to go to Ellerslie discipleship school in
Windsor, Colorado. I don't know what the future may hold, but I know who holds
the future.

[f] can be ofassistance in the future, please feel free to call on me.

In Christ’s service,

Josh Kinabrew
