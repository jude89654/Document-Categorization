MRS. LAURICE GUILLEN-FELEO

Competition Chairperson 2012

Cinemalaya Foundation

Dear Mrs. Guillen-Feleo ,

it is with great regret that I tender my resignation as member of the Selection

Committee of the New Breed and the Director‘s Showcase Categories of Cinemalaya

Philippine Independent Film Festival 2012. Through the gruelling process of selecting
. the finalists for the prestigious film festival, l have come to the conclusion that there are

indeed great filmmaking talents that are yet to be discovered and tapped in the country,

Unfortunately, the recent events involving the disqualification of a filmmaker and his film

because of creative differences have caused me to re-evaluate my participation in the

Film Festival. Clearly, the current film festival and l are working on two different

principles as to what independent filmmaking is and should be. i simply can no longer

be part of a system which I no longer believe in.

I respect the contributions of Cinemalaya to the filmmakers who have now established

themselves as formidable and important members of the ﬁlmmaking community which I

owe my passion to. it is because of this respect that l have decided to now withdraw my

name‘as member of the Selection Committee despite having participated in it by

investing my time and effort in reading through all the submitted treatments and

screenplays.

Thank you. .

Sincerely,

FRA _ SEPH A. CRUZ
