1 May 2015 Dear Mr Bum,

I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as Youth Affairs Journalist for Roving
Multimedia.

As required by my employment contract 1 am giving two weeksâ€™ notice, effective today. My last day at work
will be 15 May 2015.

I have given this decision a lot of thought I have decided that it is time for me to move on and have accepted
a position elsewhere.

Please let me know what can do to assist with the transfer of my responsibilities before leave, I would like to
take this opportunity to thank you and Roving Multimedia for having me as part of your team. I wish you all
the best for the future,

Yours sincerely,

Ellis Kwong
