Dear Sir,

I am a nurse with the Outpatient department and have served this medical institution for many long years.
However, I need to tender my resignation effective today.

I have many reasons for doing so, but the foremost would be my additional education which will be at a uni-
versity outside of the country. With such a move, I will be adding to my future professional credentials. But I
am at the same time saddened, because I will be parting ways

with an institution that has been my second home for so long.

Endosed are the medical records of my patients which might be helpful to the one who will be replacing me
in my position.

Let me thank you for the enduring friendship and enlightenment which you have all shown me during my
stay.

God Bless you all and may you have more success in the future.

Sincerely,

Nadine McAllister
