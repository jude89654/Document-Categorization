RE: POH44539 2749 AAA Lawn Mower Model #A456

Dear Customer Service Manager,

In the last 10 years, I have used your law care products on many occasions and I have been highly satisﬁed
with the results. However, I recently purchased a lawnmower from your company and have been dissatis-
ﬁed with the product.

First of all, when I unpacked the product and begin assembly, I found that was missing the plastic mower
guard and cap cover, which reluctantly took 12 weeks to get delivered Secondly, noticed after the second
use that the lawn was cutting in an irregular manner. Upon further inspection I noticed that the mower
blade was rotating at an angle.

I went to local store #567 where it was purchased and they chuckled as explained my dissatisfaction with
the product. They were rude and unhelpful, claiming that must have hit something in my lawn.

When I took the blade off. I noticed that the mower was not put together properly and a welded edge on
the coupler had split open. This was not due to operation or misuse. I veriﬁed this with a local lawnmower
service company. Since your company claims to be the "Leader in Customer Satisfaction" with a no hassle
year guarantee on all products, I would like to request that your store look into this matter and provide a
reﬁnd

A copy of the receipt and photograph of the damaged part is attached Please respond promptly, I can be
reached at 777-999-0000 or by email at jsmith@jsmithemai1.com,

Sincerely,

J ollun Smith
