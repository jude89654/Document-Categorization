Subject Complaint again still commented by security guards

Hello Sir,

This is to get to your attention that during my night shift yesterday, I was extremely ill commented by two of
the on duty security guards at the unit exit gate. As a part of my duty, I was not responsible for switching of
all the corridor lights before leaving, even if I am the last man to leave the data centre.

On refusal, I was critically charged and rebuked at dirtily. This was too much to be tolerated from someone
from the group D staffs, who in no way can i’ll behave with an HR manager for not switching of the corridor
lights.

This is not the ﬁrst time. In fact it had been observed since last few weeks with the change in shifts of the se-
curity in charge. I received a lot of complains against the mentioned two of them from my team members as
well.

I am looking forward to a quick action,

Thanks

Martha Neil
