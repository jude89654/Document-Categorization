Dear Mr. Richardson,

Sub-Complaint about the non-payment labor charges

I am Writing this letter to make a complaint against your manager that our union has not been paid labor
charges from last three months. I was appointed in the company 6 months back and since the new manager
has been appointed the labor union has not been paid a cent.

1 hope the management takes an immediate action and ensure that we get our labor charges paid from time to
time. If there is some problem with him and he is notable to pay is, please ﬁnd out that problem and help him
in ﬁnding appropriate solution to the problem.

We would like to intimate you that if the labor union is not paid in next 15 days, then we planned to go on
strike which will hamper the project work.

Thanking You,

Yours faithfully,

Wilson Gayle,

Union Head
