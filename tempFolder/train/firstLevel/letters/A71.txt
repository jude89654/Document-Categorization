Sales manager position job application letter

Applications for position as sales manager

1249 Huntington Ave.,

Boston, Mass.

Mr. Henry Jessup, White Manufacturing Co., 89 Milk Street, Columbus, 0.

Dear Sir,

Mr. A. C. Brown of the Bronson Company tells me you are in immediate need of a sales manager for the
Western Illinois territory.

Western Illinois offers a promising opportunity for the sale of farm implements and devices. During my
experience with the Johnson & Jones Company, I got to know the people of this section very well, and I
know how to approach them. The farmers are well-to-do and ready for improvements that will better their
homes, lands, and stock. There could not be a better place to start.

As Mr. Brown will tell you, I have been with the Bronson Company for ﬁve years. I started as clerk in the
credit ofﬁce, gradually working out into the ﬁeld—ﬁrst as investigator, then salesman, and for the last two
years as sales manager of the Western Virginia territory. The returns from this ﬁeld have increased 100 per
cent. since I began. With the hearty cooperation of the men on the road, I have built up a system about
which I should like to tell you. It would work out splendidly selling Deﬁance Harrows in Western Illinois.
My home is in Joliet and I want to make my headquarters there. I have no other reason for quitting the
Bronson Company, who are very fair as far as salary and advancement are considered.

My telephone number is Cherry 100. A wire or letter will bring me to Columbus to talk with you.

Very truly yours, Gerald Barbour.
