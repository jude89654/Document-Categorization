Dear Mike,

City Council, City Clerk and Executives:

This is to let all of you know that I have made a bittersweet and difﬁcult decision to retire. I have the ultimate
respect for Mike as the City Manager and have enjoyed working with all of you these past 11 years as your
City Treasurer. As you may recall, I made the decision to run again 4 years ago so that I could see the City
through the Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy. The settlements are starting to be paid out this month. Now that
this issue is coming to an end, I feel that the time is right for me to focus on my family. My retirement date is
July 7, 2012. Please be assured that I did not take stepping down ﬁom my elected position lightly. The ﬁnan-
cial stability of the City remains my top priority and I am available to provide any assistance during the tran-
sition‘

Thank you all for your support and I have enjoyed working 26 + years for the City of Burbank and will con-
tinue to call it my home for many years to come.

Sincerely,

Donna

Donna Anderson

City Treasurer, City of Burbank
