Dear (Insert name) It is with regret that with this letter. I tender my resignation from my nursing post. I have
allowed for the statutory 30 days NHS notice period, please let me know if this is acceptable as a period of
notice. Should you wish to forfeit this period of worked notice I would be willing to exchange the period for
paid absence.

1 would like to say that it has been a pleasure to work with all of my colleagues and patients and I hope to be
able to work within the trust again.

Yours Sincerely. Name
