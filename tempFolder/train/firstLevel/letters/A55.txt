Well-versed in the logistics of running a productive and proﬁtable perio practice. I am a person who is
self-motivated, takes a lot of initiative, and has great physical stamina.

I would like an opportunity to meet with you in person to discuss your personnel needs and present some
of my experience and accomplishments. A copy of my resume follows. I will follow-up next week in
hopes that this can be arranged.
