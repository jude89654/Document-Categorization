The Honorable Linda Llngle
Governor of Hawai‘i
Hawai’i State Capitol
Dear Governor Lingle:
Over the past three years, it has been a pleasure to serve our community as one of
the members of the University of Hawai‘i Board of Regents. However, given the
recent decision by the Hawai’i Supreme Court, I ﬁnd it in the best interest of the
institution to resign from my seat as the Student Regent, effective immediately
I have sincerely enjoyed the opportunity to serve our University and our State in
this capacity, and will always cherish the relationships I have fostered as a result
of my work. It is my hope that my service on the Board helped to make a positive
impact.
Thank you for your kind wisdom and your confidence in appointing me, and I
look forward to our paths crossing again in the Future
Me Ke Aloha Pumchana,
Cc: Allan R. Landon, Chair
Presley Pang, Secretary of the Board
