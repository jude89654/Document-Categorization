Ref. Sub-standard Food

Dear Mr. Kumar,

1 and my family had visited your restaurant on 16 March to celebrate my son's promotion. Unfortunately, the
sub-standard food served in your restaurant really dampened our spirits.

The dinner started off in a very disappointing way when we were served some tasteless lukewarm ﬂuid
which was passed off as Chicken Sweet-com soup. The

starters we ordered were dripping with oil, though we had speciﬁcally requested for fat free food.

The Main Course tasted equally pathetic. Though we had ordered an assortment of vegetarian as well as
non-vegetarian dishes, they all seemed to taste the same.

The only redeeming feature that evening was the courteous Service and the friendly manner in which your
waiters patiently heard our numerous complaints.

I hope in future the quality of your food is able to match up to the quality of your Service.

Best Wishes.

Kate Money
