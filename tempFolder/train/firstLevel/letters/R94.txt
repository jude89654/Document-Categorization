Dear Alfred.

This is to advise you that I have accepted the position of Marketing Manager, with Gandolfo Networks Inc.,
based in Buffalo New York.

My last my last day of work here will be June 27, 2004. This will give me three full weeks from next
Monday to complete the current marketing program design that I have recently been putting the ﬁnishing
touches on. In addition, during this period I will be able to bring both you and my deputy Aaron Roach up-
to-speed on all of the operations and outstanding issues in my department.

I am very much looking forward to the professional challenge being offered to me by Gandolfo, which as
you know, is the market leader in its ﬁeld. Incidentally. during the recruiting process the Gandolfo people
were very impressed with the experience and knowledge that I had gained here at Lithinc International over
the past ﬁve years.

In closing. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to you as my supervisor as well as to my many
friends and colleagues at Lithinc. I have truly enjoyed my years working with all of you, and am grateﬁil for
the many learning and growth opportunities I was given over the years. I wish all of you at Lithinc Intema—
tional continued success.
