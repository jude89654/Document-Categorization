Dear s

I have been offered a position with another company that is more in line with my career goals. After careful
consideration, have accepted this position. Although

I consider our current and past relationship to be very beneﬁcial, my decision is ﬁrm, and I am submitting
my two-week notice of resignation effective

immediately.

During the remainder of my stay, I will continue to conduct my business professionally and will do anything
I can to minimize the effects of my leaving.

I wish the company continued success and once again, would like to thank you for allowing me to be a part
of your team.

Yours sincerely,
