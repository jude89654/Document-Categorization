Collections at the University of Wisconsin library. Please accept the enclosed resume as application for the
internship position. Highlights of my background include: 0 Current student at the University of Wiscon-
sin-La Crosse pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree with a major in History and a minor in Ethnic and
Racial Studies 0 Two years of library experience at the Winona Public Library and one-year at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-La Crosse Murphy Library Extensive experiences with diverse cultures through volun-
teering Proﬁcient with EBSCO, Telnet (UW—L‘s Eagle), and Microsoft Ofﬁce Suites

In my research of the University of Wisconsin Library, I found the changes in the new library catalog to be
of great interest to me. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss the catalog system and how it
would relate to my work in the Department of Special Collections.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to meeting with you soon.

Sincerely,
