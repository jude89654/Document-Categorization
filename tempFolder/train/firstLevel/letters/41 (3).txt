John Mass

Chairman, Commission

California State Lottery

700 North 10th Street

Sacramento, CA 9581 1

Dear Chairman,

I am informing you of my resignation as Commissioner to the California State Lottery
effective immediately.

I have enjoyed working with you and Commissioner Menchaca as well the executive
staff, management and personnel of the Lottery.

It is my desire and intention to seek re—appointment to this Commission under Governor
Brown and since there are technicalities of the conﬁrmation procedures I am trying to
navigate the process.

In the event I am unsuccessful I wish all at the California State Lottery the very best and I
applaud the effort of all the staff to keep increasing the sales so that more funds are given
back to the education system of California.

I look forward to the future and being part of the solutions to the great State of California.
Sincerely yours,

Alix Fortunati
