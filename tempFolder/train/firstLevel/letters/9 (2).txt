Mr. Menlo Ortega
Director of Investment Funds
Dear Sir:
By the following letter of complaint, I would like to express my
un-satisfaction with the treatment received at the branch,
by the operator Francisco Garza who kindly attended at first,
until the conversation took worse paths and ending with an assault
on my wife.
We have not made any complaint to the police and we prefer
that this regrettable incident is settled in a friendly manner. But
I convey my deep un-satisfaction with what happened and
I propose a meeting with you and Mr. Francisco to fix everything
in a civilized manner.
No other tasks, yours truly
Rodrigo Diaz

(Signature)
