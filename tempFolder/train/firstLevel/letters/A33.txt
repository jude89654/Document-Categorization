John Wonderlich Open House Project 1818 N Street NW, Suite 410 Washington, DC 20036

Dear Open House Project:

I look forward to reading your report on increasing transparency and citizen involvement through technol-
ogy in the House of Representatives.

As we work to increase democracy in the People's House, guaranteeing that the voices of all the people are
heard, we must also ensure that the people are able to hear us.

Thank you for all of the work that you have done to increase public discourse on technology, accountabili-
ty, and transparency issues. I look forward to Working with you during the 110" Congress.

W NANCYPRIOSI
