Dear Mr, Brown

Subject: employee complaint letter

I am Writing this letter to lodge an ofﬁcial complaint against my team leader Mr. John Green. Mr. Green has
been continuously bullying me for the past six months.

From the time Mr. Green has become our team leader for the project, he is constantly bullying me and some
of my other colleagues too. Mr. John is responsible for creating a tensed environment in the ofﬁce which is
also the reason why we are not able to perform our jobs properly. I have already tried contacting the supervi-
sor but he was not very interested in hearing my issues which is the reason was forced to contact you for in-
vesti gating the matter.

The constant pressure from Mr. Green has led to the downfall of my self conﬁdence and self esteem. I had
already tried to deal with the situation on my own but when all the doors of escape were closed; I had no
other option than contacting you.

Kindly look into the matter as soon as possible as it is becoming very difficult for us to cope up with this
constant pressure.

Thank you for going through my complaint letter,

Sincerely,

Andy Anderson.
