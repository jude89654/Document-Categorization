To

Mr. Paul Mitchell,

South Carolina

Dear Mr. Mitchel.

I am Kimberley Wright and live in the apartment above yours. I have tried to contactyou many times but
your housekeeper tells me that you work at nights and since work in the mornings, We are notable to meet.
I am writing to you to bring to your notice that your son Brian has aparty almost every night at your place. In
case you are not aware of this, seem to take it my responsibility to intimate to you about the same. The issue
with your son‘s get together is that he plays loud music and there is the sound of laughter and sometimes
ﬁghts throughout the night sometimes as late as 4am.

I request you to take this matter seriously and as most urgent.

Thanks and regards,

Kimberley Wright
