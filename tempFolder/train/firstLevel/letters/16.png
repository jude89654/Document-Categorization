Dear sir,

Please accept this letter as my formal notice of resignation from Harvard University, effective
last date of employment 30"â€˜ October 2007, (three months from date above). The associations
I've made during my employment here will truly be memorable for years to come. I will help to
train my replacement (both Dr Susan and Dr Fionne) and tie up any loose ends while I am here
Thank you very much for the opportunity to work here

Sincerely,

(Dr Gandhi)
