Mark Richardson, Richardson

New York Contractors,

New York-11701

Dear Mr, Mark,

Sub-Complaint about the delay in the Construction

1 would like to make Complaint through this letter that you have not been doing well with the speed of Con-
struction of the building whose construction contract we have given to you. We have given this contract to
you in the year in the month of January and you told us that the Construction would be Completed by Jan
2012.

When we inspected the actual construction of the building we had found that there has not even been the
completion of 25% of the Construction. I assume that if you continue to do such kind of Construction then
you would not be able to Complete the same by even 2013 and 2012 5 far away Tatter.

We hope that after this letter you would speed up your construction and Ô¨Ånd out the causes of delay.

If you Continue such speed then we would have to reconsider the contract with you.

Thanking You, Sincerely,

David Brown
