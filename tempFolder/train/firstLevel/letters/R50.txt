Subject: Resignation from the post of Manager

Dear Mr. Michael.

This is to ofﬁcially inform you that I am resigning from the post of Finance Manager from ABB Associates
effective two weeks from now. 25th October 2015 will be my last day of work in this company.

Though it was a difﬁcult decision for me after a fruitful career at ABB Associates for the past seven years, I
think it now time to move on. I have accepted a position as a senior manager in a renowned ﬁnancial ﬁrm
and I am sure that will help me further in

my career growth.

I would like to thank you and the senior management for the wonderﬁll opportunities provided to me during
my tenure here. It was a rewarding experience to work here in the competent atmosphere and facing chal-
lenges along with my wonderful teammates
