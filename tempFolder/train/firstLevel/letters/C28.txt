Employee Complaint Letter

Dear Mr. Jason Green,

Subject formal employee complaint letter

I am writing this letter in order to lodge an official complaint against Ms. Sarah Jane who is working as a re-
ceptionist in your bank.

I have been associated with your bank for the past 15 years and have been treated well but since the time Ms.
Sarah has taken the position of receptionist, I am facing certain issues. Her nude and arrogant behavior has
forced me to write an ofﬁcial complaint letter against her. visited the bank on last Thursday and asked her
about the availability of Mr. John Brown who has handled my account for many years. I was shocked to re-
ceive a rude reply from her stating that Mr Brown would obviously be in his cabin ﬁt is a business day.

I have received the same kind of reply from her on many occasions and would request you to kindly provide
Ms. Sarah training in ethical and basic manners. Please take appropriate action on the same or would consid-
er moving to a different bank as will deﬁnitely not tolerate insult again.

Thanks for going through my complaint

Sincerely,

Mr. Daniel Green
