DSCIr Mr. RicclS This letter is to inform you that I am forced to resign my position as administrative assis-
tant for GTR

Incorporated effective immediately. This involuntary resignation is the result of sexual harassment that have
endured for six months now and can no longer allow this to be a part of my life.

Ô¨Årst informed you and several other managers of my situation when it began six months ago. Since then the
company has done nothing to remedy the situation and it is only getting worse the longer stay at the compa-
ny. I am now getting sexually explicit messages and emcis sent to

me by multiple offenders and connot work under these conditions.

have contacted on attorney and I will be filing suit immediately. I have copies of all of the correspondence
have sent to the management team and copies of the responses received. am sorry that it has come to this but
was left with no other options. I will not be able to contact you nor will you be able to contact me directly.
Please feel free to contact my attorney at 555332-4332 if you have any questions.

Sincerely Yours
