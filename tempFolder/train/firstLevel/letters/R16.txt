Dear Sir,

I request you to kindly accept my resignation from the post of Nurse in your hospital. Please treat this letter
as the one month notice I need to give to resign from the post, effective from 31 August, 2011. I wish to
pursue further studies and improve my qualiﬁcations to enable me to have

better career prospects. I have recently qualiﬁed in the entrance exams for Specialized

Nurses Training and I wish to pursue it.

I shall be only too glad to complete any other formalities which are required from my end. I also request you
to let me know about the handing over of my uniform and

other things in my custody. Thanking You,

Sincerely,
