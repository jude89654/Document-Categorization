President George W. Bush The White House Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. President,

It has always been my honor to serve at your pleasure. After much thought and consideration, I believe this is
the right time for my family and I to begin a new chapter in our lives. Please accept my resignation as Attor-
ney General of the United States, effective September 17, 2007. I am proud to have served with the career
investigators, administrative and support staff, litigators, and prosecutors in the Department of Justice. It is
because of their hard work and professionalism that our country today is safer from acts of terrorism, our
neighborhoods suffer less from violent crime, and our children are better protected from predators. You have
my deepest respect and admiration for the courage you have shown in leading our country through this ex-
traordinary time Every day as the Attorney General has been a privilege and I am honored by your trust in
me. Thank you for this opportunity to serve the American people. Rebecca and I are grateful for your friend-
ship. We will continue to keep you and Laura in our prayers and ask God to provide both of you the wisdom,
strength, and faith you need to lead our country forward. I remain by your side,

Sincerely,

weÔ¨ÅZ ~54 dd; (Z
