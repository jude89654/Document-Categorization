Dear Manager A,

Please accept this notice as my letter of resignation. My last day of
employment will be July 2, 2016.

While I have enjoyed working with the team and developing as a
professional, I have received an opportunity that would better Ô¨Åt my
professional goals. It has been truly a pleasure working for your company
and with your help I have perfected my skills in management and
marketing.

Before my last day, I would love to help out in any way that I can so that
the team will still operate smoothly even after my departure. I am open
to training any new hires or helping you and team out as much as
needed.

Manager A, thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with
Company A and I wish you and the team the best of luck. If you ever
need anything from me, feel free to contact me at janedoe@gmail.c0m or
by phone at 972.888.5566.

Thank you,

Jane Doe
