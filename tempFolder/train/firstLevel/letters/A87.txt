Sincerely, Together with this letter I would like to submit myself to join PT. The Gunner, because of my
background and experience in developing marketing department might be useful for this company.

trainee level to reach the position of Marketing Manager. Every year I always successfully perform an in-
creasing number of new customers, manage existing customers to remain a loyal customer, and re-open
previously closed markets.

proximately 120 sales staff in London, and was responsible for sales in the region tarhadap Blackburn and
Manchester.

1 look forward to the opportunity to meet you, which I will explain the potential and ability myself in more
detail and depth.

Sincerely,

Mely Ferguson
