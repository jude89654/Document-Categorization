Resignation Letter Sample Two-week Notice

Dear Mr. Solomon:

Thank you for giving me the amazing opportunity to work at AlphaTech for the past three years. I
have learned a great deal during my employment here, and will not soon forget it. I am truly
grateful for your guidance and leadership, so it is with a heavy heart that 1 must announce my
resignation.

The time has come for me to move on. This letter is to officially give my two week's notice to
AlphaTech. My last day will be on April 3rd, 2014. On my part, this was not an easy choice to make.
The past three years in this organization have been highly worthwhile. Iâ€˜ve enjoyed working for
you and managing such a magnificent team of engineers.

Please let me know what] can do to facilitate finding or training my replacement before I leave.
Best regards.

Brian O'Grady
