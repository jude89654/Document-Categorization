WEEK 7

The tasks that I did this week were just the continuation of the
tasks that I did on the previous week. Last week, I called the Audit Team
Leaders regarding the COA Week and after calling them, I summarized
the total number of Audit Team Members who will come to the Central
Ofﬁce for the anniversary and I ﬁnalized it on the second day. I also
updated the list of employees who have submitted their SALN. The list of
that I made last week was the ﬁrst batch that was already submitted to
the Human Resource Database Maintenance Service. What I updated
this week was the second batch. After updating it the whole week, I
submitted it to the HRDMS. I did the usual work such as answering
phone calls and photocopying ofﬁcial documents.

The 114th COA Anniversary Celebration has already come. Very
early in the morning, we already started preparing the ofﬁce because the
auditors from different agencies of the National Government Sector —
Cluster 6 will be arriving at 8 o’clock in the morning. We were all very
excited and busy during that day. There was a parade but we were not
able to join because the program was held in the COA Sports and
Cultural Center.
