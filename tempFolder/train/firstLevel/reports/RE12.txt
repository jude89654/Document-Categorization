Week 13, August 16 - 30

It was Monday when typhoon Maring attacked. That is the reason why I can’t go to my Ojt.Five
days early vacation I guess.

Because of the typhoon Maring, I had to rush my OJT hour for the submittion. That is why even
in the after my class I went fast in my Ojt.

Ma’am Iheng told me to count my Ojt Hours and make an overtime to ﬁnish my Ojt in time. I
stayed in CM Plaza for the inquiries in this whole week of my duty. There is no other work to do
that's why I only sat at the in inquiry table and wait for some clients.

I only went to AVM Plaza when Ma’am Jheng texted me or Sir Joel.
