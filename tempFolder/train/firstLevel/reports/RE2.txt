Week 3, June 15-19

This is just a regular day for me. Just like what I’m doing the other pass few days, I’m doing
some paper works. Files and Proﬁles of the students who are enrolled in different course or lan-
guage but this time I need to list ﬁrst then encode it after.

While I’m doing this, one person came-in to inquire our Courses or languages we offered. I in-
troduced myself ﬁrst then we started talking about the language he wants to inquire about. We
ended up our conversation when he decided to enrol the other day.

I went back to work and continue working on those files. It was Pass six o’clock in the evening
when I decided to go home.
