Week 11, July 26 — August 7

I decided to clean the ﬁlling cabinet just to make sure that all the ﬁles are in ordered and in al-
phabetical order too.
It was lunch time when I decided to go down stairs to buy food for my lunch.
After lunch, Ma’am Jheng came at the oﬁice. She told me that I can go home early. She will be the
one who will wait for the client. It was too great! I can now go home to take an early sleep.
Before going home, I make sure that the ﬁles are ready for pick up.
