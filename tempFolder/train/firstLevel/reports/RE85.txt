We apologise
You have probably read or heard that we have had a serious problem with
three frozen beef burger products that we sell in stores in the UK and Ireland.
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has told us that a number of products they
have recently tested from one of our suppliers contained horsemeat.
While the FSAI has said that the products pose no risk to public health,
we appreciate that, like us, our customers will find this absolutely unacceptable.
The products in our stores were Tesco Everyday Value 8 x Frozen Beef Burgers (397g),
Tesco 4 x Frozen Beef Quarter Pounders (4549) and a branded product,
Flamehouse Frozen Chargrilled Quarter Pounders.
We have immediately withdrawn from sale all products from the supplier
in question, from all our stores and online.
If you have any of these products at home, you can take them back to any
of our stores at any time and get a full refund. You will not need a receipt and
you can bring backjust the packaging.
We and our supplier have let you down and we apologise.

If you have any concerns, you can find out how to contact us at the bottom of this page,
or go to any of our Customer Service Desks in store, or ask to speak to your Store Manager.
So here's our promise. We will find out exactly what happened and,
when we do, weâ€™ll come back and tell you.

And we will work harder than ever with all our suppliers
to make sure this never happens again.
