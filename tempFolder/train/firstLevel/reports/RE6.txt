Week 7, June 15-20

I was waiting for the German class when ma’am Jheng texted me that the instructor for the
german class can’t come because he’s not feeling well.
It was examination week in our school that’s why I was supposed to have eight hours in my ojt but
I only spend 4 hour in one day because I need to review my notes before the exam.
