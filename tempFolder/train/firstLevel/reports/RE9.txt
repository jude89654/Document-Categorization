Week 10, July 13 — 20

I only stayed in CM Plaza for the inquiries in this whole week for my duty. There is no other
work to do thats why I only sat at the in inquiry table and wait for some clients.

I only went out for lunch and go back before one o’clock in the afternoon. I admit, It was so
tiring sitting down and wait for nothing. There is no Internet Connection at CM Plaza thats why It
was so boring. At the end of the day, I ended up Fixing the ﬁles and went home after.
