pages 5 through 16 amd pages 59 through 62, respectively, are not a required part of the
basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We and the other auditors
have applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of
management regarding the methods of measurement aml presentation of the required
supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and express no
opinion on it.

that collectively comprise the District’s basic ﬁnancial statements. The accompanying

individual major and non-major fund ﬁnancial statements and schedules. and component
unit financial statements have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied by us and
other auditors in the audit of the basic ﬁnancial statements and, in our opinion, based on
our audit and the reports of other auditors, are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole. The introductory section and
statistical section have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied by us and the
other auditors in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no
opinion on them.
