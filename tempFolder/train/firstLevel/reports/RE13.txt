Week 12, August 8 — 14

After class, I went to Cm Plaza to continue my Ojt Hours even if i only had three hours that af-
ternoon.

Sir Joel came and told me to ready the printer for the repair. I prepare the printer machine and
told Sir Joel that it was ready.

After Sir Joel get the Printer I went back to my table and work at my narrative report while wait-
ing for the clients.

It was Six o’clock when I decided to go home.
