Week 5, July 1-5

First week of July. Sir Jessie was absent so that Ma’am Jheng assign me at AVM Building near
NCST. I waited for Sir Joel to have the key in AVM Building Ofﬁce.

Before Leaving, Sir Joel instructed me to search some travel Agencies on the internet and list it
on the MS Excel. I searched almost twenty travel agencies near Manila and Cavite and listing all I
printed it out.

They also instructed me to give the salary of the trainer in German Language that day. It was ﬁve
o’clock in the afternoon when they stop. I decided to have an over-time until ﬁve thirty in the af-
ternoon.
