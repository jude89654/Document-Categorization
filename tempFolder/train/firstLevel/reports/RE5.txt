Week 6, June 8-13

It was ten thirty in the morning when Ma’am Jheng came by and She ask me to buy printer ink
for the AVM ofﬁce but the ink store was still closed at this time. So she instructed me to deliver
the ink at the AVM ofﬁce when I buy it. She gives me money worth two hundred pesos @200) for
the ink and for my transportation and then she leave.

It was one o’clock in the afternoon when I saw the ink store was open. I urgently buy the ink and
then went to AVM Office. After giving the ink I go back again here at the Cm Plaza Building.

I was at the CM Plaza Office, when three students went by and told me that they gonna have
their class here at CM Oﬁice. Their subject was German Language. We waited for Sir Felix the in-
structor for German Language. He was a little bit late this time.
