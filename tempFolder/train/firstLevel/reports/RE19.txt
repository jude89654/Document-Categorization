Day 10; Some may laugh at my task which is encoding a National Housing
Authority Guideline but they do not know that I've learned many things
May 10, 2014 which are not related in my chosen course - Bachelor of Science in
Computer Engineering. While I was encoding the NHA Guideline, l was
reading it at the same time. That is why I was able to learn new things as
well as those terms that are already familiar to me related to encoding. l
was assigned to make a copy of particular PhilHeaIth records to be save in
Microsott Excel l Microsoft Word.
After encoding all the proﬁles. Sir Lloyd asks me to printed-out all the ﬁles
I encoded to have a backup copy of this record. The National Housing

it.
