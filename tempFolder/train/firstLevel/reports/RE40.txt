WEEK 4

During the fourth week of my On-the—Job Training, new tasks were
assigned to me and performing these tasks helped me to grow as an
individual conducting my training in the workplace.

I was tasked to encode the Maintenance and Other Operating
Expenses (MOOE) of different regions. I also faxed ofﬁcial documents and
answered phone calls. My Training Supervisor asked me to bring ofﬁcial
documents to Human Resource Management Ofﬁce. My boss also asked
for my help in preparing the APSR — List of Auditees.

My Training Manager also told me to compute the Scrap Value of
Depreciable Assets and sum it all up. Lastly, one of the State Auditors
there asked me to call the Supervising Auditors to remind them
regarding the submission of the Breakdown of Actual MOOE. I was very
nervous during that time because that was my ﬁrst time to talk to the
Supervising Auditors. I was afraid they might not like the way I talk to
them, but by God’s grace, they didn’t shout at me nor get mad at me like
what I was afraid of. I talked to them with respect and with a pleasing
voice so that we will have a good conversation.
