The report is only due once a month and payment is due once a month. If is not possible to limit the check
payment to once a month, that is OK. Most likely the check number and payment dates will run a month behind
the sales reporting information. So in September report you will record the August payment.
I look forward to working with everyone. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me or
Robert Riddle.
