This week was not as heavy as the previous week but I enjoyed it
because of the new tasks that I accomplished. I was beginning to meet
people of different position/ level. They really became my inspiration for
me to be an auditor someday. I was inspired by their determination to
ﬁnish their work accordingly and I admire them for being professional in
in doing their work. I was also starting to be comfortable with the people
I work with as well as in the workplace.
