On the second day here at covered court of Coronado’s School. I
Day 25: accompanied and assist Sir Zabdael in working with ID capturing and
encoding of records of Pre-school. Elementary and Junior High School
June 4. 2014 Students. This task was not that difﬁcult for me to do but the number of
students are just too many that's why it took us so long to ﬁnish checking
records and photo capturing.
Day 26: The tasks that I did this day were just the continuation of the tasks that I did
on the previous days. Again. I was I assigned at Coronado's School. This
June 5, 2014 is my third time here. Sir Zabdael left us and went to the company ofﬁce.
Sir Noel. the son of the owner of Coronado's School assisted me and to do
hands-on ID printing using their own ID printer device while Mr. Bajana did
the student image capture using the company's DSLR camera.
I was very nervous during that time because that was my ﬁrst time to talk
to Sir Noel. I was afraid he might not like the way I talk to him. but by God's
grace. he didn‘t shout at me nor get mad at me like what I was afraid of. I
talked to him with respect and with a pleasing voice so that we will have a
good conversation.
Day 27: This is my last day of On-the-Job Training and I still needed to ﬁnish and to
perform the tasks assigned to me at Coronado’s School. Nevertheless. I
June 6, 2014 had fun doing the things assigned to me for the past four days of my On-
the-Job Training.
I was tasked to encode the Preschool. Elementary and Junior High School
students' information which contains the name. department. address.
guardian's name / parents and their contact number as well. On this day.
there are many things that I have accomplished.
