Day I Date Speciﬁc Activity! Assigned Task
Day 1; On the ﬁrst day of my On-The-Job Training (OJT). I was very excited
and somewhat nervous because of the new environment and the new
Apr. 23, 2014 people surrounding me. I didn't have any idea of what kind of people they
are and it made me adjust myself with their personalities and attitudes.
Before I was introduced to our designated department. Ms. Ana Pagara
(President and CEO of the company) oriented me about the company
rules and regulations. Even the 00's and Don'ts are discussed too. She
also introduced us OJT students to those staffs and employees who are
there that day.

It was a short briefing and orientation. After the introductions, to start with
our work. Ms. Ana assigned us at the admin ofﬁce. We did some encoding
about the ID system using the software / application named Prime
Campus Link ID system. The records are very long but it took us one
day to ﬁnish half of it. The other half was encoded by my co-trainee. We
divided it into two so that we can ﬁnish it as fast as we can. We also
encoded Students proﬁles. Our ﬁrst day was really a good start and we
was motivated to perform excellently because of what we have already
accomplished and because of the company president who is very
accommodating and kind to me and to my co-trainee.

Day 2; Our immediate supervisor. Sir Ralph accompanied us to the ofﬁce
where we will be staying during our On-the-Job Training. During that
Apr. 29, 2014 moment. I felt that I was really an ofﬁce employee already having my
own ofﬁce chair and table. The second task that Sir Ralph asked us to
do is to encode. We continued our encoding of records / information of
some nearby schools of Quezon City. These information are needed for
, , the ID scanning. Their software makes the user works efﬁciently and
_ precise. On this second day. we are given an assignment to make a
New research about their Prime Campus Link.
