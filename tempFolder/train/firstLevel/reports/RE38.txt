WEEK 3

On my third week of training, there are many things that I have
accomplished. I was tasked to encode the Ofﬁce Order of Cluster 6 from
Regions IV — XIII and CAR which contains the name of Audit Team
Leaders and Audit Team Members, their designation and position and
their agencies as well. I encoded ﬁrst the Regions IV-A and B, and Region
V, the second batch were Regions VI — IX, and the last batch were
Regions X - XIII and the Cordillera Administrative Region. I also printed
and photocopied ofﬁcial documents.

My Training Manager asked me to encode the Audit Instructions
for the Calendar Year 2013 and I also assisted him in preparing the
Cluster Accomplishment Report. Every time my Training Manager calls
me for help, I can feel my heart beating like a drum. He is very strict but
an encouraging one. He always tells me to study hard for my family,
especially for my parents who are supporting me in every way possible.

Back to my accomplishments, I was also asked to bring ofﬁcial
documents to the Professional and Institutional Development Sector and
ITO. Lastly, I collected the annexes of Audit Group Structure from
Clusters l, 2 and 4.
