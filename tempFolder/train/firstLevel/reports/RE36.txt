WEEK 2

On the second week of my On—the—Job Training, I was only able to
go to work for one day because of the Holy Week.

In the Commission on Audit, their employees’ performances and
personalities are being evaluated twice a year — lst semester and 2nd
semester. I was told to review the lst and 2nd semester assessment of the
employees. I checked if their grades on the 1st and 2nd semester tally with
the summary of the employees’ assessment. I was a little surprised
because I didn’t know that their personalities and performance are being
graded even when they are already in work. I thought that grades are
only for those who are studying but I was wrong. Even in work, every
little thing that an employee does is graded. This task was not that
difﬁcult for me to do but the employees are just too many that’s why it
took me so long to ﬁnish checking it. Nevertheless, I had fun doing the
things assigned to me for the past 4 days of my On—the—Job Training.
