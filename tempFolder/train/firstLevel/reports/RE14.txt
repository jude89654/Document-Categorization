Week 13, September 2 — 7

Sir Joel came and told me to ready the printer for the repair. I prepare the printer machine and
told Sir Joel that it was ready.

Sir Joel asked me to send the Certiﬁcate through LBC for the students who ﬁnished their Lan-
guage Course. He also gave me money for the LBC payments and Buy brown envelope for the
Certiﬁcates and Stole rent payments.

After I settle all the duties they gave me, I went back to Cm Plaza and Pay the rental for the
month.

My friend Elizabeth visit me at CM Plaza that afternoon. Then Sir Joel and Ma’am Jheng arrive
and asked me to buy coffee and French fries in MCDONALS for their merienda.

A minute pass, their student in Korean arrived. Ma’am Jheng told as to go at AVM Plaza and
Print a Copy of September Monthly Reports.

I went to AVM with Elizabeth. I went out at Six o’clock in the afternoon.
