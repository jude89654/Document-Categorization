Week 9, July 1 — 10

First week of July, Its one o’clock in the afternoon when I decided to go in Cm Plaza. Sir Joel
asked me to photocopy all the Employees Monthly Report and Students Daily records.

Ma’am Jheng, instructed me to ﬁx and clean those CPU in the other room aﬁer instructing me
she leave and went to AVM.

I texted Sir Felix to remind his class in German. I also meet his students in German. While I’m
doing this, one person came-in to inquire our Courses or languages we offered. I introduced
myself ﬁrst then we started talking about the language he wants to inquire about.

We ended up our conversation when he decided to enrol the other day.
