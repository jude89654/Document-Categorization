Week 4, June 24-29

I just stayed at the Cm Plaza Building waiting for those client want to inquire about our offered
languages. I am all alone at our ofﬁce. Too boring for an ordinary day for me.
While waiting, I decided to clean the ﬁlling cabinet just to make sure that all the ﬁles are in or-
dered and in alphabetical order too.
It was lunch time when I decided to go down stairs to buy food for my lunch.
After lunch, Ma’am Jheng came at the oﬂice. She told me that I can go home early. She will be the
one who will wait for the applicant. It was too great! I can now go home to take an early sleep.
