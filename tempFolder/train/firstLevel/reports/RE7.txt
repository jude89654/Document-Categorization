Week 8, June 24 — 29

As daily routine, I went ﬁrst to CM Plaza and clean the oﬁice. After lunch Ma’am Jheng arrive.

Ma’am Jheng, ask me to print her a copy of Monthly report. So I went to Avm Plaza to make the
report. After making those reports I went back to CM Plaza to gave the report to Ma’am Jheng.
She instructed me to pay the rent for the month of June.

Ma’am Jheng stayed at the CM Ofﬁce and leave after an hour. She allowed an early out but I
stayed in Cm Plaza until ﬁve o’clock in the afternoon.
