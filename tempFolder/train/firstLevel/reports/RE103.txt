Week 2, June 10-12

Our Company Boss, “Ma’am Jheng or ‘Madam’ ” they used to call her those names in the ofﬁce,
she assigns me a task. I encoded student proﬁles that are not active in the class. After encoding all
the proﬁles, Ma’am Jheng asks me to printed-out all the ﬁles I encoded.

After Printing all those ﬁles, Ma’am Jheng ask me to go at Cm Plaza to work on those reports
she left at the ofﬁce in Cm Plaza Building.

At the Cm Plaza Building, I started cleaning the Computer and also our working place. Then I
started listing all the monthly reports.
